<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;Recollections of Old Liverpool,&rdquo; contained in the
following pages, appeared originally the <i>Liverpool Compass</i>, their
publication extending over a period of several months.</p>
<p>When they were commenced it was intended to limit them to three, or at
the most four, chapters, but such was the interest they created, that they
were extended to their present length.</p>
<p>Those who have recorded the green memories of an old man, as told while
seated by his humble &ldquo;ingle nook&rdquo; have endeavoured to adhere to
his own words and mode of narration&mdash;hence the somewhat rambling and
discursive style of these &ldquo;Recollections&rdquo;&mdash;a style which
does not, in the opinion of many, by any means detract from their general
interest.</p>
<p>The frontispiece is copied (by special permission) from part of a very
finely-painted view of Liverpool, by Jenkinson, dated 1813, in the
possession of Thomas Dawson, Esq., Rodney-street.&nbsp; The vignette of the
Mill which stood at the North end of the St. James&rsquo; Quarry in the
title page, is from an original water colour drawing by an amateur (name
unknown), dated 1821.</p>
<p><i>November</i>, 1863.</p>
<h2><!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<p>I was born in Liverpool, on the 4th of June in 1769 or &rsquo;70.&nbsp;
I am consequently about ninety-three years old.&nbsp; My friends say I am a
wonderful old man.&nbsp; I believe I am.&nbsp; I have always enjoyed such
excellent health, that I do not know what the sensation is of a medical man
putting his finger on my wrist.&nbsp; I have eaten and drunk in moderation,
slept little, risen early, and kept a clear conscience before God and
man.&nbsp; My memory is surprising.&nbsp; I am often astonished at myself
in recalling to mind events, persons, and circumstances, that occurred so
long ago as to be almost forgotten by everybody else.</p>
<p>I can recollect every occurrence that has fallen under my cognizance,
since I was six years old.&nbsp; I do not remember so well events that have
taken place during the last twenty or thirty years, as they seem confused
to me; but whatever happened of <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>which I had some knowledge during my boyish days
and early manhood, is most vividly impressed upon my memory.&nbsp; My
family have been long-livers.&nbsp; My father was ninety odd, when he died,
my mother near that age at her death.&nbsp; My brother and sister are still
living, are healthy, and, like myself, in comfortable circumstances.</p>
<p>I may be seen any fine day on the Pier-head or Landing-stage,
accompanied by one of my dear great grandchildren; but you would not take
me to be more than sixty by my air and appearance.</p>
<p>We lived in a street out of Church-street, nearly opposite St.
Peter&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I was born there.&nbsp; At that time the churchyard
was enclosed by trees, and the gravestones were erect.&nbsp; One by one the
trees died or were destroyed by mischievous boys, and unfortunately they
were not replaced.&nbsp; The church presented then a very pretty
appearance.&nbsp; Within the last thirty years there was one tree standing
nearly opposite to the Blue Coat School.&nbsp; When that tree died, I
regretted its loss as of an old friend.&nbsp; The stocks were placed just
within the rails, nearly opposite the present extensive premises occupied
by the Elkingtons.&nbsp; Many and many a man have I seen seated in them for
various light offences, though in many cases the punishment was heavy,
especially if the culprit was obnoxious in any way, or had made himself so
by his own conduct.&nbsp; The town boys were very <!-- page 7--><a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>cruel in my young
days.&nbsp; It was a cruel time, and the effects of the slave-trade and
privateering were visible in the conduct of the lower classes and of
society generally.&nbsp; Goodness knows the town boys are cruel now, but
they are angels to what their predecessors were.&nbsp; I think education
has done some good.&nbsp; All sorts of mischievous tricks used to be played
upon the culprits in the stocks; and I have seen stout and sturdy fellows
faint under the sufferings they endured.&nbsp; By the way, at the top of
Marybone, there was once a large pond, called the Flashes, where there was
a ducking-post and this was a favourite place of punishment when the Lynch
Law of that time was carried out.&nbsp; I once saw a woman ducked
there.&nbsp; She might have said with Queen Catherine:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Do with me what you will,<br />
For any change must better my condition.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a terrible row caused once by the rescue of a woman from the
Cuckstool.&nbsp; At one time it threatened to be serious.&nbsp; The mayor
was dining at my father&rsquo;s, and I recollect he was sent for in a great
hurry, and my father and his guests all went with him to the pond.&nbsp;
The woman was nearly killed, and her life for long despaired of.&nbsp; She
was taken to the Infirmary, on the top of Shaw&rsquo;s Brow, where St.
George&rsquo;s Hall now stands.&nbsp; The way they ducked was this.&nbsp; A
long pole, which acted as a lever, was placed on a post; at <!-- page
8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>the end of the
pole was a chair, in which the culprit was seated; and by ropes at the
other end of the lever or pole, the culprit was elevated or dipped in the
water at the mercy of the wretches who had taken upon themselves the task
of executing punishment.&nbsp; The screams of the poor women who were
ducked were frightful.&nbsp; There was a ducking tub in the House of
Correction, which was in use in Mr. Howard&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; I once went
with him through the prison (as I shall describe presently) and saw it
there.&nbsp; It was not till 1804 or 1805 that it was done away with.</p>
<p>My father was owner and commander of the <i>Mary Ellen</i>.&nbsp; She
was launched on the 4th of June, my birthday, and also the anniversary of
our revered sovereign, George III.&nbsp; We used to keep his
majesty&rsquo;s birthday in great style.&nbsp; The bells were set ringing,
cannon fired, colours waved in the wind, and all the schools had
holiday.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t love the gracious Lady who presides over our
destinies less than we did her august grandfather, but I am sure we do not
keep her birthday as we did his.&nbsp; The <i>Mary Ellen</i> was launched
on the 4th of June, 1775.&nbsp; She was named after and by my mother.&nbsp;
The launch of this ship is about the first thing I can remember.&nbsp; The
day&rsquo;s proceedings are indelibly fixed upon my memory.&nbsp; We went
down to the place where the ship was built, accompanied by our
friends.&nbsp; We made quite <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>a little procession, headed by a drum and
fife.&nbsp; My father and mother walked first, leading me by the
hand.&nbsp; I had new clothes on, and I firmly believed that the joy bells
were ringing solely because <i>our</i> ship was to be launched.&nbsp; The
<i>Mary Ellen</i> was launched from a piece of open ground just beyond the
present Salt-house Dock, then called, &ldquo;the South Dock.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
suppose the exact place would be somewhere about the middle of the present
King&rsquo;s Dock.&nbsp; The bank on which the ship was built sloped down
to the river.&nbsp; There was a slight boarding round her.&nbsp; There were
several other ships and smaller vessels building near her; amongst others,
a frigate which afterwards did great damage to the enemy during the French
war.&nbsp; The government frequently gave orders for ships to be built at
Liverpool.&nbsp; The view up the river was very fine.&nbsp; There were few
houses to be seen southward.&nbsp; The mills on the Aigburth-road were the
principal objects.</p>
<p>It was a pretty sight to see the <i>Mary Ellen</i> launched.&nbsp; There
were crowds of people present, for my father was well-known and very
popular.&nbsp; When the ship moved off there was a great cheer
raised.&nbsp; I was so excited at the great &ldquo;splash&rdquo; which was
made, that I cried, and was for a time inconsolable, because they would not
launch the ship again, so that I might witness another great
&ldquo;splash.&rdquo;&nbsp; I can, in my mind&rsquo;s eye, see &ldquo;the
<!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>splash&rdquo; of the <i>Mary Ellen</i> even now.&nbsp; I really
believe the displacement of the water on that occasion opened the doors of
observation in my mind.&nbsp; After the launch there was great festivity
and hilarity.&nbsp; I believe I made myself very ill with the quantity of
fruit and good things I became possessed of.&nbsp; While the <i>Mary
Ellen</i> was fitting-up for sea, I was often taken on board.&nbsp; In her
hold were long shelves with ring-bolts in rows in several places.&nbsp; I
used to run along these shelves, little thinking what dreadful scenes would
be enacted upon them.&nbsp; The fact is that the <i>Mary Ellen</i> was
destined for the African trade, in which she made many very successful
voyages.&nbsp; In 1779, however, she was converted into a privateer.&nbsp;
My father, at the present time, would not, perhaps, be thought very
respectable; but I assure you he was so considered in those days.&nbsp; So
many people in Liverpool were, to use an old and trite sea-phrase,
&ldquo;tarred with the same brush&rdquo; that these occupations were
scarcely, indeed, were not at all, regarded as anything derogatory from a
man&rsquo;s character.&nbsp; In fact, during the privateering time, there
was scarcely a man, woman, or child in Liverpool, of any standing, that did
not hold a share in one of these ships.&nbsp; Although a slave captain, and
afterwards a privateer, my father was a kind and just man&mdash;a good
father, husband, and friend.&nbsp; His purse and advice were always ready
<!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>to
help and save, and he was, consequently, much respected by the merchants
with whom he had intercourse.&nbsp; I have been told that he was quite a
different man at sea, that there he was harsh, unbending and stern, but
still just.&nbsp; How he used to rule the turbulent spirits of his crews I
don&rsquo;t know, but certain it is that he never wanted men when other
Liverpool ship-owners were short of hands.&nbsp; Many of his seamen sailed
voyage after voyage with him.&nbsp; It was these old hands that were
attached to him who I suspect kept the others in subjection.&nbsp; The men
used to make much of me.&nbsp; They made me little sea toys, and always
brought my mother and myself presents from Africa, such as parrots,
monkeys, shells, and articles of the natives&rsquo; workmanship.&nbsp; I
recollect very well, after the <i>Mary Ellen</i> had been converted into a
privateer, that, on her return from a successful West Indian cruise, the
mate of the ship, a great big fellow, named Blake, and who was one of the
roughest and most ungainly men ever seen, would insist upon my mother
accepting a beautiful chain, of Indian workmanship, to which was attached
the miniature of a very lovely woman.&nbsp; I doubt the rascal did not come
by it very honestly, neither was a costly bracelet that one of my
father&rsquo;s best hands (once a Northwich salt-flatman) brought home for
my baby sister.&nbsp; This man would insist upon putting it on the baby
somewhere, in spite of <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>all my mother and the nurse could say; so, as
its thigh was the nearest approach to the bracelet in size of any of its
little limbs, there the bracelet was clasped.&nbsp; It fitted tightly and
baby evidently did not approve of the ornament.&nbsp; My mother took it off
when the man left.&nbsp; I have it now.&nbsp; This man used to tell queer
stories about the salt trade, and the fortunes made therein, and how they
used to land salt on stormy and dark nights on the Cheshire or Lancashire
borders, or into boats alongside, substituting the same weight of water as
the salt taken out, so that the cargo should pass muster at the Liverpool
Custom House.&nbsp; The duty was payable at the works, and the cargo was
re-weighed in Liverpool.&nbsp; If found over weight, the merchant had to
pay extra duty; and if short weight, he had to make up the deficiency in
salt.&nbsp; The trade required a large capital, and was, therefore, in few
hands.&nbsp; One house is known to have paid as much as &pound;30,000 for
duty in six weeks.&nbsp; My grandfather told me that in 1732 (time of
William and Mary), when he was a boy, the duty on salt was levied for a
term of years at first, but made perpetual in the third year of George
II.&nbsp; Sir R. Walpole proposed to set apart the proceeds of the impost
for his majesty&rsquo;s use.</p>
<p>The Salt houses occupied the site of Orford-street (called after Mr.
Blackburne&rsquo;s seat in Cheshire).&nbsp; I have often heard my
grandfather <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>speak of them as an intolerable nuisance, causing, at times, the
town to be enveloped in steam and smoke.&nbsp; These Salt houses raised
such an outcry at last that in 1703 they were removed to Garston, Mr.
Blackburne having obtained an act of Parliament relative to them for that
purpose.</p>
<p>The fine and coarse salts manufactured in Liverpool were in the
proportion of fifteen tons of Northwich or Cheshire rock-salt to forty-five
tons of seawater, to produce thirteen tons of salt.&nbsp; To show how
imperishable salt must be, if such testimony be needed, it is a fact that,
in the yard of a warehouse occupied by a friend of mine in Orford-street,
the soil was always damp previous to a change of weather, and a well
therein was of no use whatever, except for cleansing purposes, so brackish
was the water.</p>
<p>To return to the launch.&nbsp; After the feasting was over my father
treated our friends to the White House and Ranelagh Tea Gardens, which
stood at the top of Ranelagh-street.&nbsp; The site is now occupied by the
Adelphi Hotel.&nbsp; The gardens extended a long way back.&nbsp;
Warren-street is formed out of them.&nbsp; These gardens were very
tastefully arranged in beds and borders, radiating from a centre in which
was a Chinese temple, which served as an orchestra for a band to play
in.&nbsp; Round the sides of the garden, in a thicket of lilacs and
laburnums, the beauty of which, in <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>early summer, was quite
remarkable, were little alcoves or bowers wherein parties took tea or
stronger drinks.&nbsp; About half-way up the garden, the place where the
Warren-street steps are now, there used to be a large pond or tank wherein
were fish of various sorts.&nbsp; These fish were so tame that they would
come to the surface to be fed.&nbsp; This fish feeding was a very favourite
amusement with those who frequented the garden.&nbsp; In the tank were some
carp of immense size, and so fat they could hardly swim.&nbsp; Our
servant-man used to take me to the Ranelagh Gardens every fine afternoon,
as it was a favourite lounge.&nbsp; Over the garden door was
written&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You are welcome to walk here I say,<br />
But if flower or fruit you pluck<br />
One shilling you must pay.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The garden paling was carried up Copperas-hill (called after the
Copperas Works, removed in 1770, after long litigation) across to
Brownlow-hill, a white ropery extending behind the palings.&nbsp; To show
how remarkably neighbourhoods alter by time and circumstance, I recollect
it was said that Lord Molyneux, while hunting, once ran a hare down
Copperas-hill.&nbsp; A young lady, Miss Harvey, who resided near the
corner, went out to see what was the cause of the disturbance she heard,
when observing the hare, she turned it back.&nbsp; Miss Harvey used to say
&ldquo;the gentlemen swore terribly&rdquo; <!-- page 15--><a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>at her for spoiling
their sport.&nbsp; This was not seventy years ago!</p>
<p>To return to the Ranelagh Gardens.&nbsp; There was, at the close of the
gala nights, as they were called, a display of fireworks.&nbsp; They were
let off on the terrace.&nbsp; I went to see the last exhibition which took
place in 1780.&nbsp; There was, on that occasion, a concert in which Miss
Brent, (who was, by the way, a great favourite) appeared.&nbsp; Jugglers
used to exhibit in the concert-room, which was very capacious, as it would
hold at least 800 to 1000 persons.&nbsp; This concert-room was also used as
a dinner-room on great occasions, and also as a town ball-room.&nbsp;
Stephens gave his lecture on &ldquo;Heads&rdquo; in it very frequently.</p>
<p>G. A. Stephens was an actor, who, after playing about in the provincial
highways and bye-ways of the dramatic world, went to London, where he was
engaged at Covent Garden in second and third rate parts.&nbsp; He was a man
of dissipated habits, but a jovial and merry companion.&nbsp; He wrote a
great many very clever songs, which he sang with great humour.&nbsp; He got
the idea of the lectures on &ldquo;Heads&rdquo; from a working man about
one of the theatres, whom he saw imitating some of the members of the
corporation of the town in which he met with him.&nbsp; Stephens, who was
quick and ready with his pen, in a short time got up his lecture, which he
delivered all through England, <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>Scotland, Ireland, and America.&nbsp; He
realised upwards of &pound;10,000, which he took care of, as he left that
sum behind him at his death, in 1784.&nbsp; He was at the time, a
completely worn-out, imbecile old man.&nbsp; Many of the leading actors of
his day followed up the lecture on &ldquo;Heads,&rdquo; in which they
signally failed to convey the meaning of the author.&nbsp; I saw him, and
was very much amused; but I do not think he would be tolerated in the
present day.&nbsp; The elder Mathews evidently caught the idea of his
&ldquo;At Homes&rdquo; from Stephens&rsquo;s lecture.</p>
<p>Brownlow-hill was so called after Mr. Lawrence Brownlow, a gentleman who
held much property thereabout.&nbsp; Brownlow-hill was a very pleasant
walk.&nbsp; There were gardens on it, as, also, on Mount Pleasant, then
called Martindale&rsquo;s-hill, of which our friend Mr. Roscoe has sung so
sweetly.&nbsp; Martindale&rsquo;s-hill was quite a country walk when I was
a little boy.&nbsp; There was also a pleasant walk over the Moss Lake
Fields to Edge Hill.&nbsp; Where the Eye and Ear Infirmary stands there was
a stile and a foot-path to the Moss Lake Brook, across it was a wooden foot
bridge.&nbsp; The path afterwards diverged to Smithdown-lane.&nbsp; The
path-road also went on to Pembroke-place, along the present course of
Crown-street.&nbsp; I have heard my father speak of an attempt being made
to rob him on passing over the stile which stood where now you find <!--
page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>the King
William Tavern.&nbsp; He drew his sword (a weapon commonly worn by
gentlemen of the time) which so frightened the thieves that they ran away,
and, in their flight, went into a pit of water, into which my father also
ran in the darkness which prevailed.&nbsp; The thieves roared loudly for
help, which my father did not stop to accord them.&nbsp; He, being a good
swimmer, soon got out, leaving the thieves to extricate themselves as they
could.&nbsp; There were several very pleasant country walks which went up
to Low-hill through Brownlow-street, and by Love-lane (now
Fairclough-lane).&nbsp; I recollect going along Love-lane many a time with
my dear wife, when we were sweethearting.&nbsp; We used to go to Low-hill
and thence along Everton-road (then called Everton-lane), on each side of
which was a row of large trees, and we returned by Loggerhead&rsquo;s-lane
(now Everton Crescent), and so home by Richmond-row, (called after Dr.
Sylvester Richmond, a physician greatly esteemed and respected.)&nbsp; I
recollect very well the brook that ran along the present Byrom-street,
whence the tannery on the right-hand side was supplied with water.&nbsp; At
the bottom of Richmond-row used to be the kennels of the Liverpool Hunt
Club.&nbsp; They were at one time kept on the North-shore.</p>
<h2><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>I was very sorry when the Ranelagh Gardens were broken up.&nbsp; The
owner, Mr. Gibson, was the brother of the Mr. Gibson who kept the Folly
Gardens at the bottom of Folly-lane (now Islington) and top of Shaw&rsquo;s
Brow (called after Mr. Alderman Shaw, the great potter, who lived in
Dale-street, at the corner of Fontenoy-street&mdash;whose house is still
standing).&nbsp; Many a time have I played in the Folly Tea Gardens.&nbsp;
It was a pretty place, and great was the regret of the inhabitants of
Liverpool when it was resolved to build upon it.&nbsp; The Folly was closed
in 1785.&nbsp; Mr. Philip Christian built his house, now standing at the
corner of Christian-street, of the bricks of which the Tavern was
constructed.&nbsp; The Folly was a long two-storied house, with a tower or
gazebo at one end.&nbsp; Gibson, it was said, was refused permission to
extend the size of his house, so &ldquo;he built it upright,&rdquo; as he
said &ldquo;he could not build it along.&rdquo;&nbsp; The entrance <!--
page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>to the
Gardens was from Folly-lane, up a rather narrow passage.&nbsp; I rather
think the little passage at the back of the first house in Christian-street
was a part of it.&nbsp; You entered through a wooden door and went along a
shrubberied path which led to the Tavern.&nbsp; Folly-lane (now Islington)
was a narrow country lane, with fields and gardens on both sides.&nbsp; I
recollect there was a small gardener&rsquo;s cottage where the
Friends&rsquo; Institute now stands; and there was a lane alongside.&nbsp;
That lane is now called &ldquo;King-street-lane, Soho.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
remember my mother, one Sunday, buying me a lot of apples for a penny,
which were set out on a table at the gate.&nbsp; There were a great many
apple, pear, and damson trees in the garden.&nbsp; When the Friends&rsquo;
Institute was building I heard of the discovery of an old cottage, which
had been hidden from view as it were for many years.&nbsp; I went to see
it&mdash;the sight of it brought tears in my old eyes, for I recognised the
place at once, and thought of my good and kind mother, and her friendly and
loving ways.&nbsp; Where the timber-yard was once in Norton-street, there
used to be a farm-house.&nbsp; The Moss-lake Stream ran by it on its way to
Byrom-street.&nbsp; I can very well remember Norton-street and the streets
thereabout being formed.&nbsp; At the top of Stafford-street, laid out at
the same time, there was a smithy and forge; the machinery of the bellows
was turned by the water from the Moss-lake Brook, <!-- page 20--><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>which ran just behind
the present Mill Tavern.&nbsp; There the water was collected in an
extensive dam, in shape like a &ldquo;Ruperts&rsquo; Drop,&rdquo; the
overflow turned some of the mill machinery.&nbsp; Many and many a fish have
I caught out of that mill-dam.&nbsp; The fields at the back, near
Folly-lane, were flooded one winter, and frozen over, when I and many other
boys went to slide on them.</p>
<p>The Folly Gardens were very tastefully laid out.&nbsp; Mr. Gibson was a
spirited person, and spared no expense to keep the place in order.&nbsp;
There were two bowling-greens in it, and a skittle-alley.&nbsp; There was a
cockpit once, outside the gardens; but that was many years before my
time.&nbsp; It was laid bare when they were excavating for Islington
Market.&nbsp; When I was a boy its whereabouts was not known; it was
supposed to have been of great antiquity.&nbsp; How time brings things to
light!&nbsp; The gardens were full of beautiful flowers and noble
shrubs.&nbsp; There was a large fish-pond in the middle of a fine lawn, and
around it were benches for the guests, who, on fine summer evenings, used
to sit and smoke, and drink a sort of compound called
&ldquo;braggart,&rdquo; which was made of ale, sugar, spices, and eggs, I
believe.&nbsp; I used to sail a little ship in that pond, made for me by
the mate of the <i>Mary Ellen</i>.&nbsp; I one day fell in, and was pulled
out by Mr. Gibson himself, who fortunately happened to be passing near at
hand.&nbsp; He took <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>me in his arms dripping as I was, into the
tavern and I was put to bed, while a man was sent down to Church-street, to
acquaint my parents with my disaster, and for dry clothes.&nbsp; My mother
came up in a terrible fright, but my father only laughed heartily at the
accident, saying he had been overboard three times before he was my
age.&nbsp; He must have had a charmed life, if he spoke true, for I
don&rsquo;t think I could have been above eight years old then.&nbsp; My
father was well acquainted with Mr. Gibson, and after I had got on my dry
clothes, he took us up to the top of the Gazebo, or look-out tower.&nbsp;
It was a beautiful evening, and the air was quite calm and clear.&nbsp; The
view was magnificent.&nbsp; We could see Beeston Castle quite plainly, and
Halton Castle also, as well as the Cheshire shore and the Welsh
mountains.&nbsp; The view out seaward was truly fine.&nbsp; Young as I was,
I was greatly struck with the whole scene.&nbsp; It was just at the time
when the Folly Fair was held, and the many objects at our feet made the
whole view one of intense interest.&nbsp; The rooms in the tower were then
filled with company.&nbsp; Folly Fair was held on the open space of ground
afterwards used as Islington Market.&nbsp; Booths were erected opposite the
Infirmary and in Folly Lane.&nbsp; It was like all such assemblages&mdash;a
great deal of noise, drunkenness, debauchery, and foolishness.&nbsp; But
fairs were certainly different then from what they <!-- page 22--><a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>have been of late
years.&nbsp; They are now conducted in a far more orderly manner than they
were formerly.&nbsp; I went to a large one some years ago, in Manchester,
and, on comparing it with those of my young days, I could hardly believe it
was a fair.&nbsp; It seemed to be only the ghost of one, so grim and
ghastly were the proceedings.</p>
<p>I recollect the celebrated Mr. John Howard, &ldquo;the
philanthropist,&rdquo; coming to Liverpool in 1787.&nbsp; He had a letter
of introduction to my father, and was frequently at our house.&nbsp; He was
a thin, spare man, with an expressive eye and a determined look.&nbsp; He
used to go every day to the Tower Prison at the bottom of Water-street; and
he exerted himself greatly to obtain a reform in the atrocious abuses which
then existed in prison discipline.&nbsp; In the present half-century there
has been great progress made in the improvement of prison discipline,
health, and economy.&nbsp; Where formerly existed notorious and disgraceful
abuses, the most abject misery, and the very depth of dirt, we find good
management, cleanliness, reformatory measures, and firm steps taken to
reclaim both the bodies and souls of the erring.&nbsp; It is a most strange
circumstance that the once gross and frightful abuses of the prison system
did not <i>force</i> themselves upon the notice of government&mdash;did not
attract the attention of local rulers, and cry out themselves for
change.&nbsp; Still more strange is it that, although <!-- page 23--><a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>Mr Howard in 1787, and
again in 1795, and Mr. James Nield (whose acquaintance I also made in
1803), pointed out so distinctly the abuses that existed in our prisons,
the progress of reform therein was strangely slow, and moved with most
apathetic steps.&nbsp; Howard lifted up the veil and exposed to light the
iniquities prevalent within our prison walls; but no rapid change was
noticeable in consequence of his appalling revelations.&nbsp; To show how
careless the authorities were about these matters, we can see what Mr.
Nield said eight years after Mr. Howard&rsquo;s second visit, in 1795, in
his celebrated letters to Dr. Lettsom, who, by the way, resided in
Camberwell Grove, Surrey, in the house said to have belonged to the uncle
of George Barnwell.&nbsp; Now, it should be borne in mind that Mr. Howard
actually received the freedom of the borough, with many compliments upon
his exertions in the cause of the poor inmates of the gaol, and yet few or
no important steps were taken to remedy the glaring evils which he pointed
out.&nbsp; Some feeble reforms certainly did take place immediately after
his first and second visits to Liverpool, but a retrograde movement
succeeded, and things relapsed into their usual jog-trot way of dirt and
disorder.&nbsp; When Mr. Howard received the freedom of the borough an
immense fuss was made about him; people used to follow him in the street,
and he was <i>feted</i> and invited to dinners and <!-- page 24--><a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>parties; and there was
no end of speechifying.&nbsp; But what did it all come to?&nbsp; Why,
nothing, except a little cleaning out of passages and whitewashing of
walls.&nbsp; I went with Mr. Howard several times, over the Tower Prison,
and also with Mr. Nield, in 1803.&nbsp; As it then appeared I will try to
describe it.</p>
<p>The keeper of the Tower or Borough Gaol, which stood at the bottom of
Water-street in 1803, was Mr. Edward Frodsham, who was also
sergeant-at-mace.&nbsp; His salary was &pound;130 per annum.&nbsp; His fees
were 4s. for criminal prisoners, and 4s. 6d. for debtors.&nbsp; The Rev.
Edward Monk was the chaplain.&nbsp; His salary was &pound;31 10s. per
annum; but his ministrations did not appear to be very efficacious, as, on
one occasion, when Mr. Nield went to the prison chapel in company with two
of the borough magistrates, he found, out of one hundred and nine
prisoners, only six present at service.&nbsp; The sick were attended by a
surgeon from the Dispensary, in consideration of 12 guineas per annum,
contributed by the corporation to that most praiseworthy institution.&nbsp;
There was a sort of sick ward in the Tower, but it was a wretched place,
being badly ventilated and extremely dirty.&nbsp; When Mr. Nield and I
visited the prison in 1803, we did not find the slightest order or
regulation.&nbsp; The prisoners were not classed, nor indeed, separated;
men and women, boys and <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>girls, debtor and felon, young and old, were
all herded together, meeting daily in the courtyards of the prison.&nbsp;
The debtors certainly had a yard to themselves, but they had free access to
the felon&rsquo;s yard, and mixed unrestrainedly with them.&nbsp; The
prison allowance was a three-penny loaf of 1lb. 3oz. to each prisoner
daily.&nbsp; Convicts were allowed 6d. per day.&nbsp; The mayor gave a
dinner at Christmas to all the inmates.&nbsp; Firing was found by the
corporation throughout the building.&nbsp; There were seventy-one debtors
and thirty-nine felons confined on the occasion of our visit.&nbsp; In one
of the Towers there were seven rooms allotted to debtors, and three in
another tower, in what was called &ldquo;the masters side.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
poorer debtors were allowed loose straw to lie upon.&nbsp; Those who could
afford to do so, paid ls. per week for the use of a bed provided by the
gaoler.&nbsp; The detaining creditor of debtors had to pay &ldquo;groating
money,&rdquo; that is to say, 4d. per day for their maintenance.&nbsp; In
the chapel there was a gallery, close to which were five sleeping-rooms for
male debtors.&nbsp; The size of these cells was six feet by seven.&nbsp;
Over the Pilot Office in Water-street were two rooms appropriated to the
use of female debtors.&nbsp; One of these rooms contained three beds, the
other only one.&nbsp; This latter room had glazed windows, and a
fire-place, and was, comparatively speaking, comfortable.&nbsp; The same
charge was made for the beds in these <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>rooms as in other parts
of the prison.&nbsp; The debtors were also accommodated with rooms in a
house adjoining the gaol, from which, by the way, an escape of many of the
prisoners, felon and debtor, took place in 1807&mdash;a circumstance which
created immense public interest.&nbsp; When the prisoners were discovered,
they stood at bay, and it was not until they were fired upon, that they
surrendered.&nbsp; The criminals were lodged in seven close dungeons
6&frac12; feet by 5 feet 9 inches.&nbsp; These cells were ranged in a
passage 11 feet wide, under ground, and were approached by ten steps.&nbsp;
Over each cell door was an aperture which admitted such light and air as
could be found in such a place.&nbsp; Some improvement took place in this
respect after Mr. Howard&rsquo;s visit.&nbsp; There was also a large
dungeon or cell which looked upon the street, in which twelve prisoners
were confined.&nbsp; This dungeon was not considered safe, so that only
deserters were put into it.&nbsp; As many as forty persons have been
incarcerated in it at one time.&nbsp; In five of the cells there were four
prisoners; in the other two, there were only three.</p>
<p>The court-yards (one of which was 20 yards by 30, the other 20 yards by
10) were kept in a most filthy state, although a fine pump of good water
was readily accessible.&nbsp; The yards were brick-paved.&nbsp; In one yard
I noticed a large dung-heap, which, I was informed, was only removed once a
<!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>month.&nbsp; There were numbers of fowls about the yard, belonging
to the prison officials and to the prisoners.&nbsp; In these yards, as may
readily be supposed, scenes of great disorder took place.&nbsp; The utmost
licentiousness was prevalent in the prison throughout.&nbsp; Spirits and
malt liquors were freely introduced without let, hindrance, or concealment,
though against the prison rules&mdash;not one of which, by the way, (except
the feeing portion) was kept.&nbsp; The felons&rsquo;
&ldquo;garnish,&rdquo; as it was called, was abolished previous to 1809,
but the debtors&rsquo; fee remained.&nbsp; The prison was dirty in the
extreme; the mud almost ankle deep in some parts in the passages, and the
walls black and grimy.&nbsp; There seemed to be no system whatever tending
towards cleanliness, and as to health that was utterly disregarded.&nbsp;
Low typhoid fever was frequently prevalent, and numbers were swept off by
it.&nbsp; The strong prisoners used to tyrannise over the weak, and the
most frightful cases of extortion and cruelty were practised amongst them,
while the conduct of the officials was culpable in the highest
degree.&nbsp; At one time the chapel was let as an assembly room.&nbsp; The
prisoners used to get up, on public ball nights, dances of their own, as
the band could be plainly heard throughout the prison.&nbsp; The debtors
used to let down a glove or bag by means of a stick, from their tower into
the street, dangling it up and down to attract the <!-- page 28--><a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>notice of passengers,
who dropped in pieces of money for the use of the &ldquo;poor
debtors,&rdquo; which money was invariably spent in feasting and
debauchery.&nbsp; The town boys used to put stones into the bags, and
highly relished the disappointment of the &ldquo;poor debtors,&rdquo; on
discovery of their &ldquo;treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I recollect an execution taking place in front of the Tower, which
created an immense sensation throughout the country.&nbsp; In March 1789,
two men named Burns and Dowling, suffered the extreme penalty of the law
for robbing the house of Mrs. Graham, which stood on Rose Hill.&nbsp; They
broke into the lady&rsquo;s dwelling, and acted with great ferocity.&nbsp;
It was on the 23rd December previous; they entered the house, with two
others, about seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&nbsp; One stayed below,
while the others went into the different rooms armed with pistols and
knives, threatening the various members of the family with death if they
made any alarm.&nbsp; They robbed some guests in the house of nineteen
guineas, and some silver; and from Mrs. Graham they took bills to a large
amount.&nbsp; On the 7th January, following, Burns and Dowling were
arrested at Bristol, in consequence of an anonymous letter sent to the
mayor of that city, giving information of their being in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; They were on the point of embarking for Dublin, having
several packages <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>containing Mrs. Graham&rsquo;s property on
board the vessel, besides &pound;1000 in Bills of Exchange.&nbsp; Dowling
made a fierce resistance, and would have escaped, but was held by the leg
by a dog belonging to one of the constables.&nbsp; Rose Hill at that time
was quite in the suburbs, and was a very fashionable locality.&nbsp; The
town was crowded with strangers from all parts to witness the execution of
these villains.&nbsp; Men of the present day would be horror-struck at the
number of executions that took place at that time in England.&nbsp; I
recollect once when in London (I was only three days going there) seeing
three men hanging at Newgate, while the coal waggoners were letting off
their waggons as stages for spectators at twopence per head.</p>
<p>The various prisoners in the Tower were all removed to the new gaol, or
French prison, as it was called, on the French being released from custody,
at the peace of 1812.&nbsp; This prison, which stood in Great
Howard-street&mdash;I little thought I should live to see it swept
away&mdash;was designed by Mr. Howard.&nbsp; Great Howard-street was called
after him.&nbsp; The Frenchmen did so much damage to the gaol, that it cost
&pound;2000 to put it in order after their departure.&nbsp; These people
maintained themselves by making fancy articles, and carved bone and ivory
work.&nbsp; I once saw a ship made by one of them&mdash;an exquisite
specimen of ingenuity and craftsmanship.&nbsp; The ropes, which were all
spun <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>to the proper sizes, were made of the prisoner&rsquo;s
wife&rsquo;s hair.&nbsp; I had in my possession for many years, two
cabinets, with drawers, &amp;c., made of straw, and most beautifully
inlaid.</p>
<p>I went with Mr. Nield, in one of his visits to Liverpool, to inspect the
Bridewell which stood on the Fort.&nbsp; The building was intended for a
powder magazine; but being found damp, it was not long used for that
purpose.&nbsp; The keeper was Robert Walton, who was paid one guinea per
week wages.&nbsp; There were no perquisites attached to this place, neither
in &ldquo;fees&rdquo; nor &ldquo;garnish.&rdquo;&nbsp; In fact, the
prisoners confined within its dreary, damp walls had nothing to pay for,
nor expect.&nbsp; There were no accommodations of any sort.&nbsp; The
corporation certainly found &ldquo;firing,&rdquo; but nothing else, either
in beds or food, not even water.&nbsp; There was no yard to it, nor
convenience of any kind.&nbsp; Under ground were two dreary, damp, dark
vaults, approached by eight steps.&nbsp; One of them was 18 feet by 12, the
other 12 feet by 7&frac12;.&nbsp; They received little light through
iron-barred windows.&nbsp; Above were two rooms.&nbsp; One was 18 feet by
10, the other 10 feet by 9.&nbsp; Adjoining these two rooms, devoid of
fire-grate or windows, were two cells, each 5 feet by 6 feet high.&nbsp;
The prisoners in this dreadful place, were herded together, unemployed in
any way, and dependent entirely upon their friends for food.&nbsp; It was a
disgrace to humanity.&nbsp; <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>It was damp, dirty, and in a most miserable
condition.</p>
<p>An interesting circumstance connected with the Tower I find detailed in
a book of my father&rsquo;s, which he called &ldquo;<i>The Family
Log</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; It relates to the escape of some prisoners-of-war
confined in the Tower.&nbsp; My father in this &ldquo;Log,&rdquo; used to
enter up at the week&rsquo;s end any little circumstance of interest that
might have come under his notice.&nbsp; At the date of Sunday, <i>May</i>
6<i>th</i>, 1759, I find &ldquo;That fifteen French prisoners escaped from
the Tower, Durand amongst the number&rdquo;; and then follows a narrative
which I shall presently transcribe.&nbsp; I may say, incidentally, that the
prisoners-of-war in the Tower were principally Frenchmen, who had been
captured during some of our naval engagements with them.&nbsp; They
employed their time in making many curious and tasteful articles, and
displayed great ingenuity in many ways.&nbsp; Discipline in the Tower was
not very stringent, so that escapes of prisoners frequently occurred.&nbsp;
From the want of energy displayed by the authorities in recapturing those
that did escape, it was thought that government was not sorry to get rid of
some of these persons at so easy a rate, for they were a great burden on
the nation.&nbsp; The reason why Durand&rsquo;s name was mentioned as one
of those who had fled, was this:&mdash;my mother had a very
curiously-constructed foreign box, which had been <!-- page 32--><a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>broken, and which the
tradesmen in the town had one and all declined even to attempt to
repair.&nbsp; As &ldquo;the Frenchmen&rdquo; in the Tower were noted for
their ingenuity, my father made some inquiry as to whether any of them
would undertake the restoration of this box.&nbsp; Amongst others to whom
it was shown was one Felix Durand, who at once said he would try to put it
in order if my father was in no hurry for it, as it would be a tedious task
in consequence of having so many separate pieces to join together, and it
would be necessary to wait the fast binding of each cemented piece to its
corresponding fragment.</p>
<p>My father often went to see Durand, and was much pleased with his
conversation, amusing stories, and natural abilities.&nbsp; My father spoke
French well, so that they got on capitally together, and the consequence
was that my father obtained several little favours for him, and even
interceded with some friends in the government to obtain his release.&nbsp;
Durand knew of this, and, therefore, when my father found he had escaped
with the others, he was much annoyed as it completely frustrated his good
intentions towards him.&nbsp; My father used to tell us that according to
agreement he went for his box on a certain day when it was to be
finished.&nbsp; On reaching the gaol he was told of the escape of the
party, and that some of them had already been recaptured.&nbsp; It seems
that as soon as they got <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>into the street the party dispersed, either
singly or in twos and threes; but having neither food nor money, and being
quite ignorant of the English language or the localities round Liverpool,
they were quite helpless and everywhere betrayed who they were, what they
were, and where they came from.&nbsp; Some fell in with the town watchmen;
others struck out into the country, and after wandering about in a starved,
hungry, and miserable state, were very glad to get back to their old
shelter, bad as they thought it, and hardly as they considered they had
been treated.&nbsp; They admitted that their party was too large, that they
had no friends to co-operate with them outside, and no plan of action which
was possibly or likely to be carried out successfully.&nbsp; The lot of
these, however, was not shared by all, for Durand, as will be seen by his
recital, had not done amiss, thanks to his wit, ingenuity, and
cleverness.</p>
<p>The following is Durand&rsquo;s narrative:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you know, Monsieur Le Capitaine (he always called my father
so), I am a Frenchman, fond of liberty and change, and this detestable
prison became so very irksome to me, with its scanty food and straw beds on
the floor, that I had for some time determined to make my escape and go to
Ireland, where I believe sympathies are strong towards the French
nation.&nbsp; I am, as you know, acquainted with Monsieur P---, who resides
in Dale-street; I have done some work for him.&nbsp; He has a niece who is
<i>toute a faite charmante</i>.&nbsp; She has been a <!-- page 34--><a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>constant ambassador
between us, and has brought me work frequently, and taken charge of my
money when I have received any, to deposit with her uncle on my
account.&nbsp; I hold that young lady in the highest consideration.&nbsp;
This place is bad for anyone to have property in, although we are in misery
alike.&nbsp; Some of us do not know the difference between my own and thy
own.&nbsp; We have strange communist ideas in this building.&nbsp; Now
&ldquo;Monsieur Le Capitaine&rdquo; you want to know how I got away, where
I went, and how I came back.&nbsp; I will tell you.&nbsp; I could not help
it.&nbsp; I have had a pleasing three months&rsquo; holiday, and must be
content to wait for peace or death, to release me from this <i>sacre</i>
place.&nbsp; The niece of Monsieur P--- is very engaging, and when I have
had conversation with her in the hall where we are permitted to see our
friends, I obtained from her the information that on the east side of our
prison there were two houses which opened into a short narrow street.&nbsp;
One of these houses had been lately only partly tenanted, while the lower
portion of it had been under repair.&nbsp; Mademoiselle is very complacent
and kind.&nbsp; She took the trouble to go for me to the house and examine
it, and reported that there was an open yard under the eastern prison-wall,
and if anybody could get through that wall he might easily continue his
route through the house and into the street.&nbsp; My mind was soon made
up.&nbsp; I imparted my intention to my companions.&nbsp; There were
fifteen of us, altogether, penned up at night in a vile cell or vault, and,
of course, the intended escape could not be kept a secret; what was known
by one, must be known by all.&nbsp; We all resolved to escape.&nbsp; Our
cell was dirty and miserable.&nbsp; We obtained light and air from the
street as well as from a grating over the door.&nbsp; Choosing a somewhat
stormy night, we commenced by loosening the <!-- page 35--><a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>stonework in the east
wall.&nbsp; Now we knew that after we were locked up for the night we
should not be disturbed, and if we could not effect the removal of the
stones in one night, there would be no fear of discovery during the next
day, as we were seldom molested by any of the gaolers.&nbsp; We could walk
about the prison just as we liked and mix with the other prisoners, whether
felons or debtors.&nbsp; In fact your Liverpool Tower contains a large
family party.&nbsp; We worked all night at the wall, and just before
daybreak contrived to remove a large stone and soon succeeded in displacing
another, but light having at length broken, we gathered up all the mortar
and rubbish we had made, stuffing some of it into our beds, and covering
the rest with them in the best way we could.&nbsp; To aid us in preventing
the gaoler discovering what we had been about, one of our party remained in
bed when the doors were unlocked, and we curtained the window grating with
a blanket, stating that our <i>compatriote</i> was very ill and that he
could not bear the light.&nbsp; We had no dread of a doctor coming to visit
him, for unless special application was made for medical attendance on the
sick nobody seemed to care whether we lived or died.&nbsp; The day passed
over without any suspicions arising from our preparations.&nbsp; The
afternoon set in stormy, as the preceding evening had done, and in the
course of the night of our escape we had a complete hurricane of rain and
wind, which eventually greatly favoured us by clearing the streets of any
stragglers who might be prowling about.&nbsp; No sooner were we locked in
at night than we recommenced our work at the wall, and were not long in
making a hole sufficient to allow a man to creep through, which one of us
did.&nbsp; He reported himself to be in an open yard, that it was raining
very heavily, and that the night was <i>affreuse</i>; we all then crept
through.&nbsp; We found <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>ourselves in a dark yard, with a house before
us.&nbsp; We obtained a light in a shed on one side of the yard, and then
looked about.&nbsp; We found a sort of cellar door by the side of a
window.&nbsp; We tried to open it: to our surprise it yielded.&nbsp;
Screening our light we proceeded into a passage, taking off our shoes and
stockings first (some of us had none to take off, poor fellows!) so that we
should make no noise.&nbsp; The house was quite still; we scarcely dared to
breathe.&nbsp; We went forward and entered a kitchen in which were the
remains of a supper.&nbsp; We took possession of all that was eatable on
the table.&nbsp; It was wonderful that nobody heard us, for one of us let
fall a knife after cutting up a piece of beef into pieces, so that each man
might have a share.&nbsp; Although there were people in the house no one
heard us; truly you Englishmen sleep well!&nbsp; Before us was a
door&mdash;we opened it.&nbsp; It was only a closet.&nbsp; We next thought
of the window, for we dared not climb up stairs to the principal
entrance.&nbsp; We tried the shutters which we easily took down and,
fortunately without noise, opened the window, through which one of us crept
to reconnoitre.&nbsp; He was only absent about a minute or two, returning
to tell us that not a soul was to be seen anywhere; that the wind was
rushing up the main street from the sea, and that the rain was coming down
in absolute torrents.&nbsp; Just as the neighbouring church clock struck
two we were assembled under an archway together.&nbsp; We determined to
disperse, and let every man take care of himself.&nbsp; Bidding my friends
good bye I struck out into the street.&nbsp; At first I thought of going to
the river, but suddenly decided to go inland.&nbsp; I therefore went
straight on, passed the Exchange, and down a narrow street facing it
(Dale-street) in which I knew mademoiselle dwelt.&nbsp; I thought of her,
but had no hope of seeing her as I did not know the house wherein she
resided.&nbsp; I <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>pushed on, therefore, until I came to the foot
of a hill; I thought I would turn to the left, but shutting my eyes with
superstitious feelings I left myself to fate, and determined to go forward
with my eyes closed until I had by chance selected one of the four cross
roads [Old Haymarket, Townsend-lane (now Byrom-street), Dale-street, and
Shaw&rsquo;s-brow] which presented themselves for my choice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I soon found I was ascending a hill, and on opening my eyes I
discovered that I was pursuing my route in an easterly direction.&nbsp; I
passed up a narrow street with low dirty-looking houses on each side, and
from the broken mugs and earthenware my feet encountered in the darkness, I
felt sure I was passing through the outskirts of Liverpool&mdash;famous for
its earthenware manufactures.&nbsp; During all this time I had not seen a
living thing; in fact it was scarcely possible for anything to withstand
the storm that raged so vehemently.&nbsp; In this, however, rested my
safety.&nbsp; I sped on, and soon mounting the hill paused by the side of a
large windmill (Townsend mill) which stood at the top of London-road.&nbsp;
Having gained breath, I pushed forward, taking the road to the right hand
which ran before me (then called the road to Prescot).&nbsp; I began now to
breathe freely and feel some hope in my endeavour to escape.&nbsp; My
limbs, which, from long confinement in prison, were stiff at first, now
felt elastic and nimble and I pushed on at a quick pace, the wind blowing
at my back the whole time; still onward I went until I got into a country
lane and had another steep hill to mount.&nbsp; The roads were very
heavy.&nbsp; The sidewalk was badly kept, and the rain made it ankle-deep
with mud.&nbsp; On surmounting the hill, which I afterwards learned was
called Edge-hill, I still kept on to the right hand road, which was lined
on both sides <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>with high trees.&nbsp; I at length arrived at a little village
(Wavertree) as a clock was striking three; still not a soul was
visible.&nbsp; I might have been passing through a world of the dead.&nbsp;
After traversing this village I saw, on my left hand, a large pond, at
which I drew some water in my cap.&nbsp; I was completely parched with my
unusual exertions.&nbsp; Resting under a large tree which proved some
shelter, I ate up the bread and meat I had procured from the kitchen of the
house through which we had escaped.&nbsp; Having rested about half-an-hour
I again started forward.&nbsp; I now began to turn over in my mind what I
should do.&nbsp; I felt that if I could get to Ireland I could find friends
who would assist me.&nbsp; I knew a French priest in Dublin on whom I could
rely for some aid.&nbsp; I at length hit upon a course of action which I
determined to pursue.&nbsp; Through narrow lanes I went, still keeping to
the right, and after walking for more than an hour I found myself in a
quaint little village (Hale) in which there was a church then
building.&nbsp; The houses were constructed principally of timber, lath,
and plaster and were apparently of great antiquity.&nbsp; Onward still I
went, the rain beating down heavily and the wind blowing.&nbsp; In about a
quarter of an hour I gained a sight of the river or the sea, I know not
which, but I still continued my road until I came up to a little cottage,
the door of which opened just as I was passing it.&nbsp; An old woman came
out and began to take down the shutters.&nbsp; Now, as I came along the
road I had made up my mind to personate a deaf and dumb person, which would
preclude the necessity of my speaking.&nbsp; I felt I could do this well
and successfully.&nbsp; I determined to try the experiment upon this old
lady.&nbsp; I walked quietly up to her, took the shutters out of her hands
and laid them in their proper places.&nbsp; I then took a broom and began
sweeping away the water <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>which had accumulated in front of her cottage,
and seeing a kettle inside the door, I walked gravely into the house, took
it, and filled it at a pump close by.&nbsp; The old woman was
dumb-struck.&nbsp; Not a word did she say, but stood looking on with mute
amazement, which was still more intensely exhibited when I went to the
fire-place, raked out the cinders, took up some sticks and commenced making
a fire.&nbsp; Not a word passed between us.&nbsp; It was with great
difficulty I could keep my countenance.&nbsp; We must have looked a curious
couple.&nbsp; The woman standing staring at me, I sitting on a three-legged
stool, with my elbows on my knees looking steadfastly at her.&nbsp; At
length she broke this unnatural silence.&nbsp; Speaking in her broad
Lancashire dialect I could scarcely make her out.&nbsp; My own deficiency
in not understanding much English increased my difficulty, but I understood
her to ask &ldquo;Who I was, and whither I was going.&rdquo;&nbsp; This she
repeated until, having sufficiently excited her curiosity, I opened my
mouth very wide, kept my tongue quite close so that it might seem as if I
had none, and with my fingers to my ears made a gesture that I was deaf and
dumb.&nbsp; She then said, &ldquo;Poor man, poor man,&rdquo; with great
feeling and gave me a welcome.&nbsp; So I sat before the fire, and
commenced drying my clothes, which were saturated during my walk.&nbsp; I
suppose I must have fallen asleep, for the next thing I noticed was a
substantial meal laid on the table, consisting of bread, cold bacon, and
beer.&nbsp; Pointing to the food the old woman motioned to me to partake,
and this I was not loath to do.&nbsp; I made a hearty meal.&nbsp; I should
tell you, before we sat down to the table I had pulled out my pockets to
show her I had no money.&nbsp; The woman made a sign that she did not want
payment for her kindness.&nbsp; When we had finished our meal I looked
about me, and seeing that several things wanted <!-- page 40--><a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>putting to rights, such
as emptying a bucket, getting in some coals, and cleaning down the front
pavement of the house, I commenced working hard as some repayment for the
hospitality I had received.&nbsp; We Frenchmen can turn our hands to almost
anything, and my dexterity quite pleased the old lady.&nbsp; While I was
busily sweeping the hearth, I heard the sound of a horse&rsquo;s feet
coming swiftly onward.&nbsp; Terror-struck, I did a foolish thing.&nbsp;
Fancying it must be some one in pursuit of me, I dropped the little broom I
was using, seized my cap from one of the chairs, opened the back door of
the cottage, and fled along the garden walk, over-leaped a hedge, crossed a
brook, and was off like a hunted hare across the open fields.&nbsp; This
was a silly proceeding, because if the horseman had been any one in
pursuit, the chances were that, should he have entered the cottage, I might
not have been recognized; and if I had simply hid myself in some of the
outbuildings that were near I might have escaped notice altogether, while
by running across the fields I exposed myself to observation, and to be
taken.&nbsp; When half over a field I found there a small clump of trees,
and a little pond.&nbsp; Down the side of this pond I slipped and hid
myself amongst the rushes; but I need not have given myself any anxiety or
trouble, for I saw the horseman, whatever might have been his errand,
flying along the winding road in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having satisfied myself of my security, I started off and soon
found myself on the highroad again, and after a time I came near a fine old
mansion which presented a most venerable appearance.&nbsp; I could not
stop, however, to look at it, for I found I had taken a wrong turn and was
going back to Liverpool.&nbsp; I therefore retraced my steps and passed on,
going I know not whither.&nbsp; After walking for about an hour in a
southerly direction, feeling <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>tired and seeing a barn open I went to it and
found two men therein threshing wheat.&nbsp; I made signs to them that I
was deaf and dumb, and asked leave to lie in the straw.&nbsp; They stared
at me very much, whispered amongst themselves, and at length, made a sign
of assent.&nbsp; I fell asleep.&nbsp; When I awoke the sun was up and
bright, while all trace of the night-storm had disappeared.&nbsp; I
wondered at first where I was.&nbsp; Seeing the fresh straw lying about, an
idea struck me that I could earn a few pence by a little handiwork.&nbsp; I
thereupon commenced making some straw baskets, the like of which you have
often seen myself and fellow-prisoners manufacture.&nbsp; By the time I had
completed two or three the men came again into the barn and began to work
with their flails.&nbsp; I stepped forward with my baskets, which seemed to
surprise them.&nbsp; The like they had evidently never seen
before&mdash;they examined them with the greatest attention.&nbsp; One of
the men, pulling some copper money out of his pocket, offered it for one of
them.&nbsp; Grateful for the shelter I had received, I pushed back the
man&rsquo;s hand which contained the money and offered him the basket as a
present, pointing to my bed of straw.&nbsp; The honest fellow would not
accept it, saying I must have his money.&nbsp; I therefore sold him one of
the baskets, and another was also purchased by one of the other men.&nbsp;
They seemed astonishingly pleased with their bargains.&nbsp; Just as they
had concluded their dealings with me a big man came into the barn, who I
found out was the master.&nbsp; The men showed him the baskets and pointed
to me, telling the farmer that I was a &ldquo;dumby and deafy.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The big farmer hereupon bawled in my ear the question, &ldquo;who was I,
and where had I come from?&rdquo;&nbsp; I put on a perfectly stolid look
although the drum of my ears was almost split by his roaring.&nbsp; The
farmer had a soft heart, however, in his big and burly frame.&nbsp; Leaving
<!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>the
barn, he beckoned me to follow him.&nbsp; This I did.&nbsp; He went into
the farm-house, and, calling his wife, bade her get dinner ready.&nbsp; A
capital piece of beef, bread, and boiled greens or cabbages were soon on
the table, to which I sat down with the farmer and his wife.&nbsp; Their
daughter, soon after we had commenced eating, came in.&nbsp; Her attention
was immediately attracted by my remaining basket, which I had placed by
them.&nbsp; I got up from the table and presented it to her.&nbsp; Her
father then told her of my supposed infirmities.&nbsp; I could scarcely
help laughing while I heard them canvass my personal appearance, my merits
and demerits.&nbsp; Pity, however, seemed to be the predominant
feeling.&nbsp; When the dinner was over, I happened to look up at an old
clock and saw that it had stopped.&nbsp; I went up to it, and took it from
the nail.&nbsp; I saw it wanted but very little to make it go again.&nbsp;
I therefore quietly, but without taking notice of my companions, set to
work to take off the face and do the needful repairs.&nbsp; A pair of
pincers on the window-ledge and some iron wire, in fact, an old skewer,
were all the tools necessary; and very soon, to the satisfaction of my
host, his wife, and his fair daughter, the clock was set going as well as
it ever had done.&nbsp; The farmer slapped me on the back and gave me great
encouragement.&nbsp; I then cast my eyes about to see what I could do
next.&nbsp; I mended a chair, repaired a china image, cleaned an old
picture, and taking a lock from a door repaired it, altering the key so
that it became useful.&nbsp; In fact, I so busied myself, and with such
earnestness that by night-time I had done the farmer a good pound&rsquo;s
worth of repairing.&nbsp; I then had my supper, and was made to understand
I might sleep in the barn, if I liked.&nbsp; On the next morning the
farmer&rsquo;s daughter found me very busy in the yard with the pigs, which
I was feeding; in fact, the whole of that day I <!-- page 43--><a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>worked hard, because I
thought if I could remain where I was until the wonder of our escapade was
over, I might eventually get away altogether from England by some
unforeseen piece of good fortune.&nbsp; For some time I worked at this
farm, for, as if by mutual consent of the farmer and myself, I remained,
getting only my food for my work; however, at the end of each week the
farmer&rsquo;s wife gave me quietly some money.&nbsp; I made several little
fancy articles for Mademoiselle which she seemed highly to prize; but it
was through her that I left my snug quarters.&nbsp; The principal labourer
on the farm was courting, on the sly, this young woman, and I noticed he
became sulky with me, as Miss Mary on several occasions selected me to
perform some little service for her.&nbsp; From an expression I heard him
make use of to one of the other men I felt sure he was about to do me some
act of treachery and unkindness, and, as I was no match for the great
Hercules he seemed to be, I thought it best to leave the place, as any
disturbance might draw down attention upon me too closely.&nbsp; I
therefore put up my spare clothes, some of which had been given to me by
the farmer&rsquo;s wife&mdash;a kindly, Christian woman she was&mdash;and
hiding my little store of money securely in my breeches&rsquo; waistband,
very early one fine morning I set off with a heart by no means light, from
the place where I had been so well-treated, not knowing where on earth to
go or what next to do.&nbsp; Before I went, however, to show I was grateful
for their kindness, I made up a little parcel which I addressed to the
farmer&rsquo;s wife, in which I put a tobacco-box for Mr. John Bull, a
bodkin-case for herself, and a little ring for Miss Mary, all of which I
had made in my leisure time.&nbsp; I dare say they were sorry to part with
me.&nbsp; I am sure Miss Mary was, for I fancied she suspected I was not
what I seemed, and had begun to take an evident <!-- page 44--><a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>liking to me.&nbsp; I
had taught her some French modes of cooking, which excited surprise, as
well as gratification to their palates, and I taught her also two or three
little ways of making fancy articles that pleased her exceedingly.&nbsp; It
was through her manifesting a preference for me that, as I have told you,
Monsieur le Capitaine, I felt obliged to absent myself from her
father&rsquo;s employment.&nbsp; It was most difficult at first to restrain
myself from talking.&nbsp; But I soon got over that, for when I was about
to speak I made an uncertain sort of noise, which turned off
suspicion.&nbsp; That the head labourer had some doubt about me, I verily
believe.&nbsp; I thought at first I would try to get to London, but the
roads thereto, I learnt, were so bad and travelling so insecure, even for
the poorest, that I considered it best to remain in this neighbourhood, as
I wanted to see Mademoiselle P--- once more, and settle with her uncle for
the money of mine in his hands.&nbsp; I thought if I could only communicate
with him he would befriend me, so I went on my way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I travelled all that day until I got into a place called
Warrington, by the side of a river.&nbsp; It is a town full of old quaint
houses built of timber and plaster.&nbsp; I was very tired when I arrived
there at nightfall, but obtained shelter in an old house near the bridge,
and as I had the money my mistress gave me I bought some food at a little
shop; a Frenchman does not want very heavy meals, so that I did pretty
well.&nbsp; The next day I went to a baker&rsquo;s and got some more
bread.&nbsp; I interested the baker&rsquo;s wife, and when she found I was
deaf and dumb, she not only would not take money for her bread, but also
gave me some meat and potatoes.&nbsp; It seemed she had a relation affected
as I was supposed to be.&nbsp; I then went out to a farm-yard, and having
begged some straw I turned to my never-failing fountain of
help&mdash;basket <!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>making.&nbsp; I made a number of baskets and
other little things, all of which on taking into the town I sold
readily.&nbsp; I begged some more straw of a man at a stable, and set to
work again.&nbsp; I sold off my baskets and fancy articles much quicker
than I could make them.&nbsp; I soon got so well known that I excited some
attention; but one day being at a public tavern, where I had gone to
deliver a basket ordered, the word &lsquo;Liverpool&rsquo; fell upon my
ears and caused me to tremble.&nbsp; Near me sat two men who looked like
drovers.&nbsp; They were talking about Liverpool affairs: one of them told
the other that there had been lately a great fire near the dock, where a
quantity of provisions had been burnt, and much property destroyed
besides.&nbsp; They then spoke of the escape of my companions and myself,
and for the first time I heard of their fate, and how, one by one, they had
been recaptured or willingly returned.&nbsp; I then heard of their trials
and the miseries they had encountered.&nbsp; The drovers also spoke of one
prisoner who had disappeared and got away completely, but that there was a
hot search after him, as he, it was supposed, was the ringleader in the
late outbreak, and that it was planned and carried out by him.&nbsp; I felt
that they alluded to myself, and that this place would grow too warm for
me, as I knew that I was already an object of public remark, owing to my
supposed infirmities and the extraordinary dexterity of my fingers.&nbsp;
It will be recollected that I bought some bread at a little shop near the
market-place.&nbsp; Passing there the day after I arrived, I saw a bill in
the window bearing the words &ldquo;<i>lodgings to let</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; I,
therefore, by signs made the woman of the shop comprehend that I wanted
such accommodation.&nbsp; I took the bill out of the window, pointed to the
words, and the to myself; then I laid my hand on my head as if in the
attitude of sleep.&nbsp; The good woman quite comprehended <!-- page
46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>me, and nodding
her head to my dumb proposition led the way up a small flight of stairs,
and at once installed me in the vacant room.&nbsp; It was small and poorly
furnished, but very clean.&nbsp; I soon made myself at home; and never
wanted anything doing for me, so that the widow&rsquo;s intercourse with me
was very limited.&nbsp; I knew I could not write without betraying my
foreign origin, so the way I did first was to get a book and pick out words
signifying what I wanted, and from these words the good woman made out a
sentence.&nbsp; I wanted so little that we had no difficulty in making out
a dialogue.&nbsp; After hearing the talk of the drovers I determined to
leave the town without delay, for my fears of recapture quite unmanned me,
making me needlessly dread any intercourse with strangers.&nbsp; Having
thus resolved to leave Warrington I bade goodbye to my kind landlady,
giving her a trifle over her demand, and then shaped my way to the
northward.&nbsp; I went to several towns, large and small, and stayed in
Manchester a week, where I sold what I made very readily.&nbsp; My supposed
infirmities excited general commiseration everywhere, and numerous little
acts of kindness did I receive.&nbsp; I wandered about the neighbouring
towns in the vicinity for a long time, being loth to leave it for several
reasons; in fact I quite established a connection amongst the farmers and
gentry, who employed me in fabricating little articles of fancy work and
repairing all sorts of things most diverse in their natures and uses.&nbsp;
At one farm-house I mended a tea-pot and a ploughshare, and at a
gentleman&rsquo;s house, near St. Helen&rsquo;s, repaired a cart, and
almost re-built a boat, which was used on his fish-pond.&nbsp; I turned my
hand to any and everything.&nbsp; I do not say I did everything well, but I
did it satisfactorily to those who employed me.&nbsp; I now began to be
troubled about my money which was accumulating, being <!-- page 47--><a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>obliged to carry it
about with me, as I feared being pillaged of it.&nbsp; I therefore resolved
on coming back to Liverpool and finding out Monsieur P--- at all hazards,
trusting to chance that I should not be recognised.&nbsp; Who could do
so?&nbsp; Who would know me in the town save the Tower gaolers who would
scarcely be out at night; even they would not recollect me in the dark
streets of the town?&nbsp; When this resolve came upon me I was at a place
called Upholland where I had been living three or four days, repairing some
weaver&rsquo;s looms&mdash;for there are a good many weavers in that little
town.&nbsp; I had nearly finished the work I had undertaken, and was
intending to come to Liverpool direct at the end of the following week,
when my design was frustrated by a curious and most unexpected
circumstance.&nbsp; About three miles from Upholland there is a very high
hill called Ashurst.&nbsp; On the top of this is a beacon tower which looks
at a distance like a church steeple rising over the top of the hill, just
as if the body of the church were on the other side of the crest.&nbsp;
This beacon is intended to communicate alarm to the neighbouring country in
war time, it being one of a line of beacons to and from different
places.&nbsp; I had once or twice walked to this high place to enjoy the
fine prospect.&nbsp; On Sunday last I had gone there and extended my walk
down the hill to a place where the road, after passing a pretty old
entrance-gateway, moat, and old hall, dips very prettily down to bridge
over a small stream.&nbsp; This bridge (Cobb&rsquo;s Brow Bridge) is
covered with ivy, and is very picturesque.&nbsp; Just before the road
rather abruptly descends there are, on the right hand side of it, a number
of remarkably old and noble oak trees, quite giants.&nbsp; Some are
hollowed out, and one is so large that it will accommodate several
persons.&nbsp; This tree has been used by what you call gipsies&mdash;and
shows that fire has been made in it.</p>
<p><!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>&ldquo;Well, on Sunday, in the afternoon, I was sitting under one
of these fine old trees, when I saw a cavalcade coming down the road,
consisting of two ladies and a gentleman mounted on fine horses, and
attended by two serving-men or grooms.&nbsp; When the party had arrived
opposite the trees they stopped to examine them, when one of the ladies,
struck with the wonderful size of the largest tree, expressed her
admiration of it in very purely-pronounced French.&nbsp; I was so surprised
that I became completely unnerved, was thrown off my guard, and, in the
excitement of the moment, at hearing my native tongue so beautifully
pronounced, sprang up, and rushing forward echoed in my own tongue the
lady&rsquo;s commendation of those grand old trees.&nbsp; I immediately
found out my error, for, to my grief, the other young lady, whom I at once
recognized, exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Why this is the dumb man who was at the
Hall the other day repairing the broken glass vases!&rdquo;&nbsp; I at
first denied that such was the case, but on the grooms coming up they both
identified me.&nbsp; In fact, I knew both from having applied to the
younger of the two, only a few days previously, to obtain for me employment
in the house of his master, in any way my services could be made
available.&nbsp; Thus I had through him obtained permission to repair the
vases which had been much injured, and which I had most successfully put in
order.&nbsp; The gentleman then asked me who I was, called me an impostor,
and ordered his servants to seize me.&nbsp; This they did, when I at once
admitted who I was and where I came from.&nbsp; The gentleman, although
entreated most earnestly by the ladies to allow me to go away, would not
consent to his servants releasing me, but ordered them to take me to
Ormschurch (Ormskirk), about five miles distant, and have me put into the
little prison there, which you call the cage.&nbsp; The ladies, with <!--
page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>tears in
their eyes, on seeing me thus seized by the servant-men, bade them not use
me roughly, and one of them slipped a gold piece into my hand, bidding me
in French to be of good cheer, for there was a talk of immediate peace,
when I should be released.&nbsp; The gentleman rode away calling the young
ladies to follow him without delay, bidding, at the same time, the servants
to see that I was delivered over to the proper authorities at Ormschurch,
so that I might be transmitted to Liverpool.&nbsp; As soon as the master
and the ladies were out of sight, one of the men, who rode a stout horse,
bade me get up behind him, which I did, and in about an hour we arrived in
the town.&nbsp; It was full of people in their Sunday clothes.&nbsp; My
appearance attracted some notice, I was pitied by some, execrated by
others, and followed by crowds of boys.&nbsp; After waiting in the street
some time I was taken before a stout, growling old gentleman, who ordered
me to be locked up until the next morning, and to have meat and drink given
me.&nbsp; I was then to be taken to Liverpool and delivered over to my
gaoler again.&nbsp; In accordance with this order I was put into a small
square room, on the floor of which was a quantity of straw.&nbsp; There
were benches fixed in the walls.&nbsp; There was no fire-place and it was
sadly uncomfortable.&nbsp; However, soon after I was locked up, I received
a good supply of bread, meat, and beer; and, as the straw was tolerably
fresh and clean, I did not fare so badly.&nbsp; I therefore lay down,
covered myself up with the straw, and was soon fast asleep.&nbsp; I awoke
once, but as everything was dark, I composed myself to sleep again and did
not awake until morning.&nbsp; About six o&rsquo;clock, as I knew by the
church-clock hard by, I was aroused and told to be ready to start for
Liverpool, whereupon I presented myself at the door, and found an open cart
in waiting.&nbsp; Into this I <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>was put, and, after a tiresome journey over
some of the worst roads I had ever seen in my life, I arrived here last
night, having enjoyed a three months&rsquo; holiday to my great
satisfaction.&nbsp; Here, then, I am, waiting for death or peace to release
me.&nbsp; I shall now finish your box if you are not too offended with me
for neglecting your commission so long.&nbsp; I may tell you that
Mademoiselle P--- was here this morning; tears were in her lovely eyes, and
she seemed very glad to see me back, at which I somewhat wondered,
especially if she esteemed me.&nbsp; I should have thought she would rather
have relished my escaping altogether, than being again caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here ends Durand&rsquo;s narrative.</p>
<p>My father appends a note to the effect that, through the intervention of
Sir Edward Cunliffe, one of the members for Liverpool, Durand was released
from the Tower, and went to reside with Mr. P--- in Dale-street.&nbsp; At
the date of September following there is a memorandum to the effect that M.
Durand and Miss P--- had become man and wife, so that, as my father
quaintly adds, he supposes M. Durand had by that time found out why it was
that old P---&rsquo;s niece was so glad to see him again in prison.</p>
<p>The House of Correction stood at the back of the present Fever Hospital,
the entrance being in Mount Pleasant.&nbsp; It was in Mr. Howard&rsquo;s
time a most miserably managed place.&nbsp; In 1790 it was a vile hole of
iniquity.&nbsp; There was a whipping-post, for instance, in the yard, at
which females <!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>were weekly in the receipt of punishment.&nbsp; There was also
&ldquo;a cuckstool,&rdquo; or ducking tub, where refractory prisoners were
brought to their senses, and in which persons on their first admission into
the gaol were ducked, if they refused or could not pay &ldquo;a
garnish.&rdquo;&nbsp; This barbarous mode of punishment was common in
Lancashire, and Cheshire.&nbsp; This prison was in the course of the
following years much improved, as it was found by Mr. Neild very clean and
orderly through the exertions of Mrs. Widdows, the keeper.&nbsp; Mrs.
Widdow&rsquo;s salary was &pound;63 per annum.&nbsp; She had resolutely put
down the cuckstool, and the whipping-post was becoming in a complete state
of desuetude.&nbsp; A pump in the men&rsquo;s yard was used as a place of
occasional punishment for the stubborn and refractory.&nbsp; The prisoners
were without any instruction, secular or religious.&nbsp; No chaplain
attended.&nbsp; The allowance to each prisoner was a two-penny loaf, two
pounds of potatoes, and salt daily.&nbsp; I believe, from all I could
learn, that the Liverpool prisons, bad as they undoubtedly were at the
close of the last and the beginning of the present century, were in better
condition than others elsewhere.</p>

52</span>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p>One of my great-grandsons&mdash;a fine young fellow, has joined the
Volunteers: and seems determined to work his way to a commission.&nbsp; I
cannot help smiling when I see him in his uniform, for he reminds me of my
young days, when I was a full private in Pudsey Dawson&rsquo;s Liverpool
Volunteers.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think the volunteers of this day are so
smart-looking as they were of olden time, when they wore blue coats, white
breeches, gaiters and pig-tails, and used pipe-clay in abundance.&nbsp;
When we were reviewed on Moss-Lake Fields we made a gallant show.&nbsp;
There are fine young fellows now, but somehow the dark rifle-dress looks
sombre and dull.&nbsp; Pudsey Dawson&rsquo;s regiment consisted of eight
companies of infantry, and mustered 1200 strong.</p>
<p>The mettle of the Liverpool men was shown in 1797, for some time about
the end of February or <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>the beginning of March, in that year the whole
town was put into the utmost fright, confusion and excitement.&nbsp; Two
French frigates having landed in Cardigan Bay upwards of 2,000 men, it was
reported in Liverpool (the report being traced to the master of a little
Welsh coasting smack, who had come from Cardigan) that the French were
marching on to Liverpool to burn, sack and plunder it, in revenge for the
frigates which had been launched from her yards, and the immense losses
sustained by the French mercantile marine through the privateers that
hailed from this port.&nbsp; Owing to the low state of education then
prevalent amongst the lower&mdash;and, indeed, in the middle
classes&mdash;very few knew where Cardigan Bay was situated and I very much
question whether, if a map of Europe, or of England and Wales, had been
shown, nine people out of ten could, without much difficulty, have pointed
out the place.&nbsp; But that the French had landed in Cardigan Bay was a
known fact; and it was firmly believed that they were on their way to
Liverpool, destroying every thing on their march.&nbsp; It was fully
believed also that the privateers which swarmed out of our docks were the
cause of this exhibition of ill-feeling towards us.&nbsp; It may be fairly
stated that the enormous sums obtained by captures from the enemy by
Liverpool privateers proved the main foundation-stone of the present great
<!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>prosperity of the port.&nbsp; I must say I was and am proud of my
fellow townsmen&rsquo;s spirit in &rsquo;97, and their show of pluck.&nbsp;
No sooner was the report current that the French might be expected, than
meetings took place at which his Worship the Mayor and the authorities
generally, exhibited the most lively feeling towards supporting their
fellow citizens in their intention of defending the port, their homes, and
hearths, from the ruthless invaders.&nbsp; Men, money, and arms, came forth
freely, and even boys&mdash;mere lads&mdash;urgently begged to be allowed
to join the ranks of England&rsquo;s bold defenders.&nbsp; But I must not
conceal the fact that, in many cases, great cowardice was exhibited; as,
when the report got current and the cry was rife that &ldquo;the French
were coming&rdquo;&mdash;a cry that used to frighten naughty children to
the verge of terror&mdash;numbers of the inhabitants became panic-struck,
and actually packed up their furniture and valuables, and commenced a hasty
exodus believing that they would be safer inland than by the
seaboard.&nbsp; I saw cartload after cartload of goods, toiling up
Prescot-road, Brownlow-hill, Mount Pleasant, Oldhall-street, and
Preston-road, accompanied by weeping and terrified women and children, with
the deepest anxiety exhibited on their countenances.&nbsp; The outskirt
roads were like a fair.&nbsp; It will scarcely be believed that the price
of cartage rose so high while the panic lasted, <!-- page 55--><a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>that fabulous sums were
asked and obtained for transporting goods out of town.&nbsp; It at length
became impossible to obtain a vehicle of any description.&nbsp; Hundreds of
persons might be seen camping along the high roads at some distance from
the town, anxiously awaiting the expected sound of cannon, the clash of
arms, and the cry of contending men.&nbsp; I laugh at this now&mdash;but it
was no laughing matter then.&nbsp; I recollect one day passing down
Dale-street (then a narrow, inconvenient thoroughfare) to muster, when the
Warrington and Manchester coach was about to start: numbers of frightened
people besieged it and attempted to turn out and off those who had obtained
possession of its lumbering inside and its miserable basket behind.&nbsp;
In it I remember was seated a tremendous man, a town councillor, who fairly
roared and cried like a child because the driver would not hasten his
departure&mdash;the cry of &ldquo;the French&rdquo; annihilated him, and I
had half a mind to let off my fire-lock and see what the result would have
been.&nbsp; We were not much addicted to punctuality in those good old
times; so that half an hour&rsquo;s delay in the starting of a coach was
held as nothing very important&mdash;the delay however seemed a year to the
worthy magnate.</p>
<p>In the town the utmost excitement prevailed.&nbsp; At the Pier Heads, at
the Fort, and in St. <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>Nicholas&rsquo;s churchyard (in the lower part
of which there was a battery of six guns) might have been seen hundreds of
stalwart fellows strengthening the fortifications; men in and out of
uniform were marching through the town with drum and fife, some armed and
some unarmed, coming and going from or to the rendezvous.&nbsp; The jolly
sailors in the port mustered strong, and hearty were their demonstrations
of enthusiasm.&nbsp; The shops were shut in many of the streets, while
barricades were prepared at the street ends leading out of town, ready to
be put up at any moment.&nbsp; Information was then so slow in its
journeyings that falsehood became as strong-looking as truth, and it was
easy to keep up a ferment for some time.&nbsp; Any atom of news became a
mountain, until the fresh air of truth melted it away.&nbsp; We were
therefore kept for days in a state of great excitement, and it certainly
was some time before our warlike spirit subsided, and I must say that
although we were somewhat laughed at for our extraordinary haste in coming
to the conclusions we did, we had nothing to be ashamed of.&nbsp; We
Liverpool men showed our pluck on that and many other occasions during the
French war.&nbsp; I fear we were a little too much alive.&nbsp; We had too
much pugnacity about us if anything.&nbsp; I recollect some poor simple
looking French fishermen in that year put into Liverpool, in order to sell
some <!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>oysters, when it was all once taken for granted that they were
spies, sent to ascertain what we were doing.&nbsp; The mayor at a meeting
held to consider the state of the harbour-defences, actually alluded to
these poor fishermen as having in their possession the soundings and
bearings of the harbour and river-entrance.&nbsp; I, for one, did not
believe in their being spies, never having seen such a lot of harmless,
stupid-looking men.</p>
<p>About this period the press-gang was very actively engaged in taking men
for the navy.&nbsp; These gangs were made up of the very worst and most
violent men in the service.&nbsp; They were by no means particular whom
they took: to them a man was a man, and that was a sufficient reason for
securing him.&nbsp; Cases of horrible cruelty and great hardship frequently
occurred to individuals.&nbsp; Men were constantly torn from their homes,
wives, and families, without a moment&rsquo;s warning.&nbsp; They
disappeared and were not heard of for years, or perhaps not at all.&nbsp;
There was a man I knew who was seized in Pool-lane and hurried off to the
tender, and was not heard of for four years, when he returned suddenly as
his wife was about to be married for the third time since his
departure.&nbsp; His arrival, with a good store of pay, and prize-money,
was ample compensation for the loss of the new husband.&nbsp; Terrible rows
took place between the press-gangs and the sailor-men&mdash;the <!-- page
58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>latter resisted
to the very death any attempt to capture them.&nbsp; Blood was frequently
shed, and loss of life was not uncommon.&nbsp; I recollect one murderous
business with which I should have been mixed up if I had not made my escape
by running into a house in Atherton-street.&nbsp; The men used to get
across the water to Cheshire to hide until their ships were ready to
sail.&nbsp; Near Egremont, on the shore, there used to be a little low
public-house, known as &ldquo;Mother Redcap&rsquo;s,&rdquo; from the fact
of the owner always wearing a red hood or cap.&nbsp; This public-house is
still standing.&nbsp; I have often been in it.&nbsp; At that time there
were no inner walls to divide the room on the upper floor; but only a few
screens put up of about seven or eight feet in height to form
apartments.&nbsp; The roof was not latted or plastered.&nbsp; When I last
saw it, some twenty-five years or more ago, the joists and timbers were all
open to view.&nbsp; Mother Redcap was a great favourite with the sailor-men
and had their entire confidence.&nbsp; She had hiding-places for any
number, and the men used, on returning from their voyages, to deposit with
her their pay and prize-money, until they wanted it.&nbsp; It was known, or
at least, very commonly believed, that Mother Redcap had in her possession
enormous (for her) sums of money, hidden or put away somewhere; but where
that somewhere was, it was never known; for, at her <!-- page 59--><a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>death, very little
property was found in her possession, although only a few days before she
was taken ill and died, a rich prize was brought into Liverpool which
yielded every sailor on board at least a thousand pounds.&nbsp; Mother
Redcap&rsquo;s was swarming with sailors belonging to the privateer,
directly after the vessel had come into port, and it was known that the old
lady had received a good deal of the prize-money on their account, yet none
of it was ever discovered.&nbsp; It is a very remarkable circumstance that
some few years ago, I think about ten or twelve, but I forget exactly when,
a quantity of money in spade-ace guineas was found in a cavity by the
shore, not far from Mother Redcap&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It has always been a firm
belief with me that some day a rich harvest will be in store for
somebody&mdash;a case of treasure trove like that which some years ago was
known as &ldquo;the Cuerdly Find.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mother Redcap&rsquo;s was
the resort of many a rough, hard-hunted fellow, and many a strange story
has been told, and scene enacted, under the old roof.</p>
<p>The passage of the river then and at the beginning of the last century,
until steam-boats were introduced, was a complete and serious voyage, which
few undertook.&nbsp; The boatmen used to run their boats at one time on the
beach opposite the end of Water-street and ply for hire.&nbsp; After the
piers were ran out they hooked on at the steps <!-- page 60--><a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>calling aloud,
&ldquo;Woodside, ahoy!&rdquo; &ldquo;Seacombe, ahoy!&rdquo; and so
on.&nbsp; It is a fact that thousands of Liverpool people at that time
never were in Cheshire in their lives.&nbsp; We used to cross in open or
half-decked boats, and sometimes we have been almost as many hours in
crossing as we are now minutes.&nbsp; I recollect once wanting to go to
Woodside on a stormy day, to see a man who lived in a small house between
the Ferry-house and Wallasey Pool, and which, by the way, was the only
house then standing thereabout.&nbsp; The tide was running very strong and
the wind blowing hard, and, after nearly four hours hard work, we managed
to land near the Rock Perch, thankful for our lives being spared.&nbsp; The
Rock Perch was a pole with a sort of beacon or basket at the top of it,
implanted in the rocks on which the lighthouse now stands.&nbsp; There were
no houses then anywhere about what is now called New Brighton.&nbsp; The
country was sandy and barren, and the only trees that existed grew close to
the mouth of the river near the shore.&nbsp; There was scarcely a house
between the Rock and Wallasey.&nbsp; Wirrall at that time and the middle of
the last century was a desperate region.&nbsp; The inhabitants were nearly
all wreckers or smugglers&mdash;they ostensibly carried on the trade and
calling of fishermen, farm-labourers, and small farmers; but they were
deeply saturated with the sin of <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>covetousness, and many a fierce fire has been
lighted on the Wirrall shore on stormy nights to lure the good ship on the
Burbo or Hoyle Banks, there to beat, and strain, and throb, until her
timbers parted, and her planks were floating in confusion on the stormy
waves.&nbsp; Fine times, then, for the Cheshire men.&nbsp; On stormy days
and nights, crowds might have been seen hurrying to the shore with carts,
barrows, horses, asses, and oxen even, which were made to draw timber,
bales, boxes, or anything that the raging waters might have cast up.&nbsp;
Many a half-drowned sailor has had a knock on the sconce whilst trying to
obtain a footing, that has sent him reeling back into the seething water,
and many a house has been suddenly replenished with eatables and
drinkables, and furniture and garniture, where previously bare walls and
wretched accommodation only were visible.&nbsp; Then for
smuggling&mdash;fine times the runners used to have in my young days.&nbsp;
Scarcely a house in north Wirral that could not provide a guest with a good
stiff glass of brandy or Hollands.&nbsp; The fishermen used to pretend to
cast their nets to take the fish that then abounded on our coasts, but
their fishing was of a far different sort.&nbsp; Formby, on this side, was
a great place for smugglers and smuggling.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think they
wrecked as the Cheshire people did&mdash;these latter were very
fiends.&nbsp; The <!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>Formby fishermen were pretty honest and
hardworking, and could always make a good living by their calling, so that
the smuggling they did was nothing to be compared to their Cheshire
compatriots.&nbsp; Strings upon strings of ponies have I seen coming along
the road from Formby, laden with the finny spoil.&nbsp; The ponies had
panniers slung over their backs, while sometimes the fisherman&rsquo;s wife
or child, if the horse could bear the double burden, was seated between
them.&nbsp; These were called &ldquo;Formby Trotters.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
were good fish caught in the river at that time; and I have heard say that
herrings used to be taken in great profusion in our vicinity until the
people fought at the Fish Stones by St. Nicholas&rsquo;s Church wall, and
blood was shed on the occasion.&nbsp; Many a fisherman steadfastly believed
that the herrings then left the coast, and never returned in
consequence.&nbsp; Wallasey was certainly, at one period, a great place for
the curing of herrings, as can be proved by tradition as well as written
history.</p>
<p>How well I recollect the Woodside Ferry when I was a boy.&nbsp; There
was a long causeway at it, which ran into the river, formed of logs of wood
and large boulder stones.&nbsp; Up this causeway you walked until you came
to the overhanging shore which on the left hand was cut away to admit the
causeway continuing up into the land.&nbsp; There <!-- page 63--><a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>was a small thicket of
trees on the rock-top and a patch of garden which belonged to the
ferryman.&nbsp; The only house visible was a farm-house which stood on the
spot where the (Gough&rsquo;s) Woodside Hotel may now be found.&nbsp; It
had a garden enclosed by a hedge round it.&nbsp; The road to Bidston was a
rough, rutted way, and the land was for the most part marshy between
Woodside and Bidston, and the country looked very desolate, wild, and
rugged.&nbsp; There were some pretty walks over the fields.&nbsp; There was
one from Holt Hill to Oxton which I was very fond of.&nbsp; When the
weather was fine I have had many and many a pleasant ramble over land where
now houses show themselves in hundreds, nay, thousands, and where I have
gone bird-nesting, and picking wild flowers, and mushrooming in their
season.&nbsp; Lord! what changes I have seen and yet live to see; and I am
very thankful for His mercies, which have been manifold and abundant.&nbsp;
Wallasey Pool was a glorious piece of water once, and many a good fish I
have taken out of it in the upper waters.&nbsp; The view of Birkenhead
Priory was at one time very picturesque, before they built the church near
it and the houses round it.&nbsp; I recollect when there was not a dwelling
near it.&nbsp; It seemed to stand out well in the landscape, and certainly
looked very pretty.&nbsp; It was a great shame that persons should have
been permitted <!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>to carry away the stones for building or any other purpose.&nbsp;
Had not a stop at last been put to this sort of work there would not in
time have been a vestige of the old Abbey left.&nbsp; I recollect that
there was a belief that a tunnel or subterraneous passage ran under the
Mersey to Liverpool from the Priory, and that the entrance in 1818, when
the church was built, had been found and a good way traversed.&nbsp; That
passage was commonly spoken of as being in existence when I was a boy, and
I often vowed I would try to find it.&nbsp; I have been up the tunnels or
caves at the Red and White Noses many a time for great distances.&nbsp; I
was once fishing for codling at the Perch, and with two young companions
went up the caves for at least a mile, and could have gone further only we
became frightened as our lights went out.&nbsp; It was thought these caves
ran up to Chester Cathedral&mdash;but that was all stuff.&nbsp; I believe
they were excavated by smugglers in part, and partly natural cavities of
the earth.&nbsp; We knew little then of archaeology or geology, or any
other &ldquo;ology,&rdquo; or I might be able to tell a good deal about
these caves, for I saw them more than once, but I now forget what their
size and height was.&nbsp; The floor, I recollect, was very uneven and
strewed about with big stones, while the roof was arched over in the red
sand-stone.&nbsp; The encroachment of the sea upon the Wirral shore has
been very gradual, <!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>but regular, for many years.&nbsp; Within the
memory of man the sea has made an inroad of nearly, if not quite, a mile
from its former high-water mark.&nbsp; It was not until the erection of the
Wallasey embankment that a stop was put to its ravages.</p>
<p>When I stand on the Pier-head, or take my daily walk on the
Landing-Stage, I often pause and revolve in my mind the wonderful changes
that have taken place in my time in this native town of mine.&nbsp; The
other day, soon after the completion of the large Landing-Stage, I sat down
and thought would any man then making use of the old baths, swimming inside
the palisade, have not considered me, some eighty years ago, a mad fool to
have predicted that before I died I should sit on a long floating stage two
or three hundred yards from where we were swimming, that would be about a
quarter of a mile in length, and that between it and the shore there would
be most wonderful docks built, in which the ships of all nations would
display their colours, and discharge their precious freights?&nbsp; As I
sat there the other day, I thought of the one bath and the old houses by
the river&rsquo;s brink, and the Bath-street, along which came, in the
summer-time, such strings of country &ldquo;dowkers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Beyond
the baths there were no houses, all was open shore consisting of boulder
stones, sand, and pools, such as may be seen on any sea-beach.&nbsp; There
was hot as well as cold water <!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>bathing in the baths, and a palisade ran out
into the river, within which, at high-water, persons could swim, as in a
plunge-bath.&nbsp; These baths were erected originally by Mr. Wright, who
sold them to the corporation in 1774, by which body they were enlarged and
greatly improved.</p>
<p>I recollect the bath-woman sold a sort of parliament cake, covered over
with coloured sugar plums, and also some sweet things which in appearance
resembled slugs.&nbsp; I never see these caraway-cakes and confections in
the low shops in which they are now only sold, without thinking of the fat
old bath-woman, who was a terror to me and others of my size and age.&nbsp;
In 1816 these baths were discontinued and pulled down on the opening of
George&rsquo;s Pier-head baths.&nbsp; For a mile or more there was good
bathing on the shore.&nbsp; The bathing machines were introduced about the
end of the last century.&nbsp; The keeper of the &ldquo;Wishing
Gate-house&rdquo; had several, and an old man who lived in a low hut near
the mill (the remains of which still stand in the Waterloo-road) had two or
three, and made money by them.&nbsp; At that time Bootle and Bootle Marshes
were wild places, the roads execrable, and as for frogs (Bootle organs),
the noise they made at night was wonderful.&nbsp; I recollect all the docks
and streets from Bath-street downwards being sand-hills and
salt-marshes.&nbsp; New Quay, of which Bath-street was a <!-- page 67--><a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>continuation, was a
sort of haven, into which small vessels, at certain times of the tide, ran
to discharge their cargoes.&nbsp; On the tide receding the vessels were
left high and dry upon the bank.&nbsp; Bathers used to be seen in any
number on the shore.&nbsp; Decency was so frequently outraged that the
authorities were at last compelled to take steps to redress the
grievance.&nbsp; Not far from the baths was once a pleasant public walk of
which I have often heard my father and mother speak.&nbsp; It was called
the &ldquo;Ladies Walk,&rdquo; and extended from the site of the present
Canal bridge by Old Hall-street, down to the river.&nbsp; It was a sort of
a terraced gravel walk, having four rows of fine Lombardy poplars, and
seats underneath.&nbsp; On fine evenings all the gay and fashionable world
of Liverpool used to take the air and show off their hoops and high heels,
and the gentlemen their brocaded silk coats, and three-cornered hats.&nbsp;
The sword was often drawn by the gallants for some fancied affront, and
occasionally a little blood was spilt, a matter of no moment in those
days.&nbsp; Great was the grief when it was announced that the Leeds and
Liverpool Canal Company had resolved on the destruction of the Ladies
Walk.</p>
<p>There was another Ladies Walk in Duke-street, which extended from
opposite the present York-street (then called Great George-street) to
Berry-street.&nbsp; This was afterwards converted into a <!-- page 68--><a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>ropery and succeeded by
Parr-street.&nbsp; By the way, Duke-street, which occupies a portion of its
site, has been famous for notable persons residing in it.&nbsp; In the
third house from Colquitt-street Felicia Hemans was born, and she wrote
some of her early poetry there.&nbsp; In the yard of the next house was
once a tree, the last remnant of the Ladies Walk, which had two rows of
trees down the sides and centre as in the other Ladies Walk previously
mentioned.&nbsp; Mrs. Hemans apostrophizes this tree in one of her early
poems.&nbsp; I recollect her very well, for she was intimate with my
friends, the Nicholsons, who lived at the top of Richmond-row some forty
years ago.&nbsp; Miss Browne received much advice and encouragement from
Mr. Nicholson, and she was a most pleasing person.&nbsp; As Mrs. Hemans,
her life was not happy.&nbsp; She resided at one time at Wavertree, in one
of those cottages on the left hand side of the road just beyond
Orford-street.&nbsp; The present &ldquo;Loggerheads Tavern Revived&rdquo;
was Mr. Nicholson&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; It was a public-house, called
&ldquo;The Loggerheads&rdquo; before he converted it into a private
dwelling.&nbsp; Where Soho-street now begins there was a dyer&rsquo;s pond
and yard; over it was a fine weeping-willow.&nbsp; In Duke-street also
lodged at one time Thomas Campbell, the poet.&nbsp; He occupied part of the
house now converted into a cabinet-maker&rsquo;s shop by Messrs.
Abbot.&nbsp; I visited Mr. <!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>Campbell several times when he was preparing
&ldquo;The Pleasures of Hope&rdquo; for publication.&nbsp; He was a very
handsome young man, with a fine face and bright eyes.&nbsp; Mr. John Howard
lodged in Duke-street in the house directly facing Cornwallis-street, then
newly built.&nbsp; At this time his &ldquo;Report on Prisons&rdquo; was
passing through the Warrington Press; and he used to journey backwards and
forwards to correct the proofs.&nbsp; The Rev. Gilbert Wakefield lodged in
Duke-street, near the bottom, when he was first appointed curate to St.
Paul&rsquo;s church, then just erected.&nbsp; Dr. Henderson was the first
incumbent of that church.&nbsp; Strangely enough, he seceded from the
Dissenting body, while Mr. Wakefield joined it from the Church.&nbsp;
Curious stories were told of Dr. Henderson&rsquo;s ministration.&nbsp; Mr.
Wakefield complained bitterly of the unkindness and inhospitality of the
Liverpool clergy.&nbsp; He said he never was invited but by one brother
clergyman to visit him during his stay in Liverpool.</p>
<p>In 1812, Bellingham, who shot Mr. Percival in the House of Commons, on
the 11th of May, also lived in Duke-street, about the sixth house above
Slater-street.&nbsp; His wife was a dressmaker and milliner.&nbsp; She was
a very nice person, and after Bellingham&rsquo;s execution the ladies of
Liverpool raised a subscription for, and greatly patronized her.&nbsp;
Bellingham was born at St. Neot&rsquo;s, in <!-- page 70--><a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>Huntingdonshire, about
1771.&nbsp; His father was a land-surveyor and miniature-painter.&nbsp;
Becoming insane, he was for some time confined in St. Luke&rsquo;s
Hospital, London; but being found incurable he was taken home, where he
died soon afterwards.&nbsp; Bellingham, at the age of fourteen, was
apprenticed to a jeweller in Whitechapel, named Love, from whom, after
giving much trouble and annoyance, he ran away.&nbsp; In 1786 his
mother&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s husband, a Mr. Daw, yielding to the
solicitations of his wife and Mrs. Bellingham, fitted the young man out for
India, whither he sailed in the ship <i>Hartwell</i>, in the
Company&rsquo;s service.&nbsp; This vessel was wrecked off one of the Cape
de Verd Islands, and young Bellingham managed to get home again,
penniless&mdash;having lost everything he possessed.&nbsp; Still influenced
by his female relatives, Mr. Daw next took a shop in the tinware trade for
Bellingham.&nbsp; This shop was in Oxford-street; but a fire occurring in
it, Bellingham asserted that he had a large number of bank-notes
destroyed.&nbsp; It was suspected he was cognizant of the origin of this
fire; but nothing could be proved against him.&nbsp; In 1794 he became
bankrupt; but his creditors were so disgusted with the statement of his
affairs, that they would not grant him his certificate, and he never
obtained it.&nbsp; We next find him obtaining employment in a
merchant&rsquo;s counting-house; and after <!-- page 71--><a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>being with them some
time he was sent out by them to Archangel.&nbsp; He remained there about
three years, and then entered into partnership with a firm there.&nbsp; He
then came to Hull where he entered into contracts for the delivery of
&pound;12,000 worth of timber, but only &pound;4,000 worth was ever
delivered upon the bills drawn, accepted, and paid.&nbsp; Upon this
transaction Bellingham was arrested and imprisoned in Hull, where he
remained seven months.&nbsp; On his release he went back to Archangel,
where he had no sooner arrived than he was again thrown into prison.&nbsp;
He appealed vehemently against this arrest to the English Consul, and also
to the British Ambassador at St. Petersburg, Lord Levison Gower; but they
both declined interfering, as they considered his arrest legal and
justifiable.&nbsp; On his release he came to Liverpool, whence he went to
Dublin, where he met his future wife, Miss Neville, a native of
Newry.&nbsp; Having become possessed of a legacy of &pound;400, left him by
his aunt, Mrs. Daw, he returned to Liverpool, where he commenced business
as an Insurance and General Broker.&nbsp; He now began memorializing the
government on the subject of his claims upon Russia.&nbsp; General
Gascoigne presented his petitions.&nbsp; All he got was a constant refusal
of interference.&nbsp; There is no doubt that some of the wrongs he
complained of were partly imaginary, and that he perhaps inherited <!--
page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>his
father&rsquo;s malady.&nbsp; Finding his appeals of no avail he determined
upon being revenged in some way or other upon somebody.&nbsp; On the 11th
May, 1812, he posted himself, soon after five o&rsquo;clock, near the door
of the lobby of the House of Commons, and as Mr. Spencer Percival
approached, he drew a pistol from his breast pocket, and fired at the right
honourable gentleman.&nbsp; The shot took effect, and Mr. Percival died
almost immediately afterwards.&nbsp; General Gascoigne, one of the members
for Liverpool, was one of the first to recognize the assassin, and, in
fact, seized him and took from him his pistols.&nbsp; It was not thought he
had any particular enmity against Mr. Percival, but that he would have
assassinated any other of His Majesty&rsquo;s Ministers had they fallen in
his way at the time.&nbsp; He said he had been a fortnight making up his
mind to this bloody deed.&nbsp; He bought his pistols from a well-known
gunmaker in Fleet-street, and so desirous was he that they could be
depended upon, that he went to Primrose Hill, in the outskirts of London,
to try them.&nbsp; It was said that he had his coat altered, and a
capacious and readily accessible pocket made in it; in which pocket, in
fact, the discharged pistol was found.&nbsp; Bellingham to the last
maintained his contumacious and determined character.&nbsp; He justified
his frightful deed, and expressed himself resigned to his <!-- page 73--><a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>fate and prepared to
meet it.&nbsp; His atrocious act caused a great sensation in the
town.&nbsp; The news that it had been perpetrated, had, however, scarcely
reached us in Liverpool before we heard of his trial and execution.&nbsp;
He was tried on the 16th of May and executed on the 18th.&nbsp; Short
shriving was then the mode!</p>
<p>In Suffolk-street, which runs out of Duke-street, there once dwelt a
droll person named Peter Tyrer.&nbsp; He let out coaches and horses for
hire.&nbsp; Many funny stories were current about him.&nbsp; I recollect
one to the effect that a customer of his, a gentleman residing in
Duke-street, complained several times that Peter had supplied him with a
coach so stiff in the springs as to be quite unpleasant to ride in
it.&nbsp; The next time a coach was sent for by this gentleman, Peter sent
him a hearse!&nbsp; On being asked his reason for so doing, his reply was
that &ldquo;so many people had ridden in that vehicle and never made any
complaint, that he supposed it must be a very comfortable
conveyance.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p>Before I exhaust my recollections of Duke-street and its celebrities, I
ought not to omit mention of a worthy gentleman who resided in it, and
whose name occupied the attention of the public in many ways, in all
honourable to himself, as a man, a soldier, and a citizen.&nbsp; I refer to
Colonel Bolton, whose mansion in Duke-street, between Suffolk-street and
Kent-street (called after, and by Mr. Kent, who lived at the corner of the
street, and who also named the streets adjacent after the southern
counties), was in bye-gone years the head-quarters of the Tory party in
Liverpool, in election times.&nbsp; From the balcony of that house, wherein
the utmost hospitality was always exercised, the great statesmen who have
represented Liverpool in Parliament&mdash;George Canning and William
Huskisson&mdash;have many a time poured forth the floods of their
eloquence, <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>stirring up the heart&rsquo;s-blood of the thousands assembled in
the street to hear them, making pulses beat quicker, and exciting passions
to fever-heat.&nbsp; Mr. Canning used also to address the electors from Sir
Thomas Brancker&rsquo;s house in Rodney-street.</p>
<p>The lengths to which election zeal carried men may be understood, when,
during the progress of an election, business was suspended in the town for
days and days.&nbsp; Hatred, envy, and malice were engendered.&nbsp;
Neighbour was set against neighbour, and I have known many instances where
serious divisions in families have taken place when opposite sides in
politics have been chosen by the members of such families.&nbsp; It has
required years to heal wounds made in family circles, and time in some
instances never succeeded in bringing relatives to esteem each other
again.&nbsp; The small knot of reformers in this town stuck manfully
together and fought their battles well; and if the Tory side could boast of
substantial names amongst their ranks, those of Henry Brougham, Egerton
Smith, Dr. Shepherd, Mr. Mulock, Edward Rushton, and many others, occupy a
place in the pantheon of worthies who stood forward on all great and public
occasions when improvement in the constitution was to be advocated.&nbsp; I
recollect a time when it was scarcely wise for a man to confess himself a
reformer.&nbsp; At the beginning of this century, when the horrors <!--
page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>of the
French Revolution were fresh in all men&rsquo;s minds, and knowing so well
as we did that there were many mischievous, dangerous, and disaffected
people amongst us, ripe and ready to foment and foster broils, bringing
anarchy and confusion in their train, it seemed to be the duty of all men
who had characters and property to lose, to stick fast to the state as it
was, without daring to change anything, however trifling or however
necessary.&nbsp; A man was almost thought a traitor to talk of reform or
change at one time, for there were not a few influential men who would
rather have risen on the ruins of Old England than have fallen with her
glory.&nbsp; Ticklish times we had in the beginning of the present
century.</p>
<p>On the subject of Reform, it was said that an elector one day meeting
Mr. Brougham in Castle-street, thus accosted him:&mdash;&ldquo;Well,
Mister, so you are going to try for Reform again?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the great orator, &ldquo;and I hope we shall get
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Elector:&mdash;&ldquo;Very good, Mister, we really do want
a reform in parliament, for I think it is a very hard thing that a man can
only get a paltry &pound;5 or &pound;10 for his vote.&nbsp; There ought to
be some fixed sum&mdash;certainly not less than &pound;25.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the most remarkable election events that has taken place in
Liverpool was that in which Messrs. Ewart and Denison were engaged <!--
page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>in
1830.&nbsp; Remarkable not only for the vigour with which it was carried
on, but for the intense excitement that it created, the number of days it
occupied, and also for the enormous sums of money it cost.&nbsp; The
bribery that took place on both sides and all sides was really
frightful.&nbsp; It was a positive disgrace to humanity.&nbsp; The contest
was continued for seven days.&nbsp; While it was carried on business in the
town was partly suspended, and all men&rsquo;s thoughts, and acts, and
interests, seemed engrossed by the one prevailing subject.&nbsp; On the
death of Mr. Huskisson, those interested in political matters set about to
look for a successor to represent their interests in parliament.&nbsp;
Several distinguished gentlemen were invited to stand; amongst others were
Sir Robert Peel, and the Right Hon. Charles Grant, both of whom, however,
declined the honour.&nbsp; Mr. Grant had had enough of an election contest
to last him for some time, his success at Inverness had only been won by
too hard fighting to be lightly thought of; while Sir Robert Peel freely
confessed that the duties of Home Secretary were such as to prevent him
from devoting sufficient time to the interests of so large and important a
constituency as that of Liverpool.</p>
<p>By the way, I recollect a rather curious anecdote of Mr. Huskisson,
which may perhaps not be devoid of interest.&nbsp; About 1834 I was dining
on <!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>board one of the beautiful American sailing-packets, the <i>George
Washington</i>.&nbsp; It was only a small party, and amongst others present
was the late Sir George Drinkwater, who related the following curious
circumstance connected with Mr. Huskisson:&mdash;Sir George told us that
the day before the lamentable occurrence took place, which deprived this
town of a valuable representative, and the country of so distinguished a
statesman, Mr. Huskisson called upon him at the Town Hall (Sir George being
then Mayor), and asked permission to write a letter.&nbsp; While doing so
an announcement was made that there was a deputation from Hyde, near
Manchester, wishing to see Mr. Huskisson.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said that
gentleman, &ldquo;I know what they want; but I will send them back to Hyde
with a flea in their ears!&rdquo;&nbsp; The gentlemen of the deputation
having been ushered into the room, they stated their case, to the effect
that they solicited Mr. Huskisson to support a petition in parliament to
enable them to construct a railway between their town and Manchester.&nbsp;
They had no sooner stated their errand than Mr. Huskisson, angrily throwing
down his pen, in very few words refused their request, winding up his reply
with these memorable words&mdash;remarkable not only for the fallacy of his
then opinions, but also in connection with the calamitous event of the next
day&mdash;&ldquo;Gentlemen, <!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>I supported the scheme of the railway between
Liverpool and Manchester as an experiment, but as long as I have the honour
to hold a seat in parliament, <i>I will never consent to see England
gridironed by railways</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; What would Mr. Huskisson say
now-a-days, when a map of England shows it not only gridironed, but spread
over as with an iron net-work of railroads, that to the eye appear in a
state of a inextricable entanglement?</p>
<p>To return to the election of 1830.&nbsp; During seven days the town was
kept at fever-heat, each day its intensity becoming heightened.&nbsp;
Denison, in his opening address on &rsquo;Change, on the 14th October, in
appealing to the constituency for support, avowed himself entitled to it,
not only as being Mr. Huskisson&rsquo;s friend&mdash;&ldquo;the friend of
your friend&rdquo;&mdash;but an enthusiastic admirer of his
principles.&nbsp; Mr. Denison was son-in-law to the Duke of Portland.&nbsp;
Mr. Ewart was a townsman, and a barrister, and had represented the town of
Bletchingly (or Bl<i>ee</i>ching<i>ly</i>, as they call it in Surrey), so
that both candidates came well recommended.&nbsp; The writ was moved for in
the House of Commons on the 17th November, and received in Liverpool on the
Friday following.&nbsp; An army of canvassers was organised on both sides,
who plied their vocations in all directions.&nbsp; Mr. Denison&rsquo;s
friends mustered on Tuesday <!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>morning, 23rd November, in front of Mr.
Bolton&rsquo;s house in Duke-street, and moved in grand procession to the
Town Hall.&nbsp; Amongst them were Mr. Bolton, Mr. Gladstone, Sir J. Tobin,
Messrs. Wm. Brown, Ritson, Shand, and Garnett.&nbsp; Mr. Ewart&rsquo;s
friends met opposite to the Adelphi Hotel.&nbsp; The horses were taken from
Mr. Ewart&rsquo;s carriage, which was then drawn by the people.&nbsp; With
Mr. Ewart were Messrs. J. Brancker, Hugh Jones, W. Wallace Currie, W.
Earle, jun., Hall (barrister), Captain Colquitt, Rev. Wm. Shepherd,
etc.&nbsp; The processions were both got up in admirable style; splendid
and costly banners and flags of all descriptions were displayed, while
ribbons, of which Denison&rsquo;s were scarlet, and Ewart&rsquo;s blue,
fluttered in the wind in all directions.&nbsp; The following was the result
of the polls.&nbsp; I give it to show how remarkably close the contest was
carried on, and how the tide of favour ebbed and flowed: 1st
day&mdash;Denison, 260; Ewart, 248.&nbsp; 2nd day&mdash;Denison, 583;
Ewart, 568.&nbsp; 3rd day&mdash;Denison, 930; Ewart, 918.&nbsp; 4th
day&mdash;Denison; 1320; Ewart, 1308.&nbsp; 5th day&mdash;Denison, 1700;
Ewart, 1688.&nbsp; 6th day&mdash;Denison, 2020; Ewart, 2008.&nbsp; 7th
day&mdash;Denison, 2186; Ewart, 2215.&nbsp; The number of freemen who voted
was 4401.</p>
<p>If ever a borough deserved disfranchising, it was Liverpool on that
election.&nbsp; The conduct of the freemen was atrocious.&nbsp; I speak of
them as <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>a body.&nbsp; The bribery on that occasion was so broad,
barefaced, and unblushingly carried on, as to excite disgust in all
thoughtful men&rsquo;s minds.&nbsp; Sums of money &pound;3 to &pound;100
were said to have been given for votes, and I recollect that after the heat
of the election had subsided, a list of those who voted was published, with
the sums attached, which were paid to and received by each freeman.&nbsp; I
have a copy of it in my possession.&nbsp; Whether true or false who can
tell?&nbsp; Where there is fire there will be smoke.&nbsp; It is a
well-known fact that many of the canvassers never looked behind them after
that memorable time, and numbers of tradesmen signally benefited by the
money that was spread about with such liberal hands.&nbsp; In some cases
money was received by freemen from both parties.&nbsp; In one case I find a
man (among the H&rsquo;s) voting for Mr. Denison, who received &pound;35
and &pound;10.&nbsp; Amongst the C&rsquo;s was a recipient of &pound;28 and
&pound;25 from each side; and another, a Mr. C., took &pound;50 from
Denison and &pound;15 from Ewart, the said voter being a chimney-sweeper,
and favouring Mr. Denison with the weight of his influence and the honour
of his suffrage.&nbsp; In looking over the list I find that the principal
recipients of the good things going, were ropers, coopers, sailmakers, and
shipwrights.&nbsp; Yet the name of &ldquo;merchant&rdquo; and
&ldquo;tradesman&rdquo; not unfrequently occurs in the descriptions of
borough <!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>voters.&nbsp; Amongst the W&rsquo;s there appears to be scarcely a
voter that escaped &ldquo;the gold fever.&rdquo;&nbsp; Amongst others who
declined taking any part in the election was Mr. Brooks Yates; he, feeling
so disgusted with the veniality of the voters, and the bribery that was
going on, publicly protested on the seventh day against the conduct of all
parties, and said &ldquo;he lifted up his voice against the practice of
bribery, which was so glaringly exercised, and which had been carried on by
both parties to the utmost extent.&nbsp; The friends of Mr. Ewart had made
use of his name to fill up their complement without his authority, and he
begged to withdraw it, for he was resolved to remain decidedly
neutral.&nbsp; The corruption was so gross and flagrant that he would not
give his vote on either side.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is said that this election
cost upwards of &pound;100,000, of which sum Colonel Bolton supplied
&pound;10,000.&nbsp; Mr. Ewart&rsquo;s family it was understood, entirely
furnished his expenses amounting to &pound;65,000.&nbsp; Mr.
Denison&rsquo;s reached from &pound;47,000 to &pound;50,000.</p>
<p>Amongst those who addressed the various meetings during the week of the
election, and previous to the commencement of the polling, were Mr. William
Rathbone, Mr. Henderson, barrister (afterwards recorder), Rev. W. Shepherd,
Captain Colquitt, Mr. James Brancker (who proposed and seconded Mr. Ewart),
and Mr. <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>Falvey.&nbsp; The orators on the part of Mr. Denison were, Mr.
Edward Rushton (afterwards stipendiary magistrate), Messrs. Shand, W. Brown
(now Sir William Brown), John Bolton, W. Earle, Leyland, Sir John Tobin,
etc.&nbsp; About the fourth day of the election the real excitement
commenced, and the baneful system of bribery was resorted to.&nbsp; On the
fifth day the prices of votes advanced from &pound;20 to &pound;25, and as
much as &pound;40 to &pound;50 were asked and obtained.&nbsp; It was
expected that on the sixth day the contest would close, but it seemed to be
then continued with unabated vigour.&nbsp; On the seventh day voters were
brought from all parts of England, Scotland, Ireland, and wherever they
could be met with.&nbsp; The tricks played by both parties on voters were
most amusing, either to deter or compel them to vote.&nbsp; Nearly four
hundred freemen declined or were unable to record their votes.</p>
<p>Even in the elections for mayor the most inconceivable interest was
excited, and in one case, that of 1828, between Messrs. Porter and
Robinson, from &pound;16,000 to &pound;20,000, if not a larger sum, was
said to have been expended in carrying the day.&nbsp; I recollect a worthy
tobacconist, who kept a little shop in the town, who had a vote and was not
inclined to sell it cheap.&nbsp; In every insidious way was he assailed to
part with his vote.&nbsp; On the occasion of this election the list of
voters was <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>rapidly running out to the last drop; the hour of closing the poll
was approaching, and it was found impossible to keep the poll open another
day.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, Mr. Pipes, what about your vote?&mdash;it&rsquo;s
half-past three!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Call again in a quarter of an
hour.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this quarter of an hour the little
tobacconist&rsquo;s shop was besieged by canvassers on both sides, when the
tempting sum of &pound;30 was reached.&nbsp; The cunning little Abel
Drugger knew his value, but no higher sum would either party advance.&nbsp;
Pipes had, unfortunately, gone into the back part of his shop for a few
minutes, when a wag put his clock back thirteen minutes.&nbsp; Keeping his
eye, while in the shop, on the clock, every now and then&mdash;although, as
he admitted afterwards, it seemed a long quarter of an hour&mdash;he still
kept off his persecutors.&nbsp; When the hand approached the quarter on the
false-telling dial, one canvasser, bolder than the rest, laid &pound;35 on
a box of cigars, as the bid for it.&nbsp; But Master Pipes only was sold,
for just as he was about to take up the tissue paper bearing the magic name
of Henry Hase, St. George&rsquo;s church struck four, and the prize was
re-pocketed to the great discomfiture of &ldquo;Pipes,&rdquo; and the
merriment of his customers.&nbsp; Of electioneering tricks I could tell a
full score.</p>
<p>The practice of the &ldquo;Duello&rdquo; is, happily, now gone quite out
of fashion, but in my young days <!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>any and every occasion of offence was seized
upon as a <i>casus belli</i>.&nbsp; Duels were fought on the most frivolous
occasions and for the slightest possible affronts, intentional or
supposititious.</p>
<p>This taste has subsided, as well as that for hard drinking.&nbsp; I can
remember both being carried to a lamentable state of excess; but these
practices have grown out of date.&nbsp; I have seen, thank goodness, other
equally salutary improvements in morals, customs, and manners.</p>
<p>Two remarkable hostile meetings, I recollect, took place in Liverpool at
the commencement of the present century, and caused an immense sensation,
from the known position and high standing of all the parties concerned.</p>
<p>The first duel I shall mention was that between Mr. Sparling, late of
St. Domingo House, Everton, and Mr. Grayson, an eminent shipbuilder.&nbsp;
Both gentlemen moved in the first circles of society in the town.&nbsp; It
took place on the 24th of February, 1804.</p>
<p>The occasion of the duel was a conversation that occurred in Mr.
Grayson&rsquo;s carriage, between that gentleman and Major Brooks (who was
shot by Colonel Bolton in the ensuing year), on their way to dine at Mr.
Grayson&rsquo;s, at Wavertree.&nbsp; Mr. Grayson, it seems, called Mr.
Sparling &ldquo;a villain,&rdquo; for breaking off the marriage between
himself and a relative of Mr. Grayson&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Major Brooks <!-- page
86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>repeated this
conversation to Mr. Sparling, who instantly commenced a correspondence with
Mr. Grayson, calling upon him to apologise for his language.&nbsp; This
correspondence continued from October until the time the duel was
fought&mdash;the meeting being the consequence of the unsatisfactory
results of the communications between the parties.&nbsp; They met at a
place called Knot&rsquo;s Hole, near the shore by the Aigburth-road.&nbsp;
Mr. Sparling was attended by Captain Colquitt, commanding the
<i>Princess</i> frigate, then in the river.&nbsp; Mr. Grayson&rsquo;s
second was Dr. MacCartney.&nbsp; After the fatal shots were fired Mr.
Grayson&rsquo;s servant found his master alone, lying on the ground with
his face downwards.&nbsp; He was desperately wounded in the thigh, and was
taken back to Liverpool as quickly as possible.&nbsp; He lingered until the
following Sunday, when he died.&nbsp; Mr. Sparling and Captain Colquitt
were, at the coroner&rsquo;s inquest, found guilty of murder, and were
tried at Lancaster, on the 4th of April, before Sir Alan Chambre.&nbsp;
Sergeant Cockle, Attorney-General for the County Palatine of Lancaster, led
for the crown; with him were Messrs. Clark and Scarlett (afterwards Sir
James); attorneys, Messrs. Ellames and Norris.&nbsp; For the prisoners,
Messrs. Park (afterwards Baron Park), Wood, Topping, Raincock, and Heald;
attorney, Mr. William Statham.</p>
<p>It came out in evidence during the trial, that the <!-- page 87--><a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>hour of meeting was
seven o&rsquo;clock on Sunday morning, February 24th.&nbsp; Mr. Sparling
and Captain Colquitt arrived first at Park Chapel; on alighting the Captain
carried the pistol-case, and the two gentlemen went through a gate into a
field opposite, to the place of rendezvous.&nbsp; Soon after Dr. MacCartney
and Mr. Park, the surgeon, arrived in a carriage.&nbsp; Mr. Park had been
induced to accompany the Doctor on the representation that he was about to
attend a patient of some consequence, and required his (Mr. Park&rsquo;s)
advice and skill.&nbsp; Soon after Mr. Grayson arrived on foot, attended by
his servant, when, finding the two gentlemen in waiting, he pulled out his
watch, and remarked that he feared he was rather late, but that it was all
his servant&rsquo;s fault.&nbsp; Dr. MacCartney then took out the
pistol-case from the carriage (leaving Mr. Park in it, who had declined
proceeding any further), and with Mr. Grayson passed through the same gate
as did Mr. Sparling and the Captain.&nbsp; They then went down the field
towards the river, and soon afterwards a shot or shots were heard by Mr.
Park, Mr. Grayson&rsquo;s servant, and the post-boys.&nbsp; Mr.
Grayson&rsquo;s servant ran into the field, and met Mr. Sparling and
Captain Colquitt hurrying up the foot-road, the former asked him
&ldquo;what he wanted?&rdquo; he told him who he was, when Mr. Sparling
informed him his master was severely wounded.&nbsp; The two <!-- page
88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>gentlemen then
ran onward when they met Mr. Park, who had got out of the carriage on
seeing them coming towards the road in such a hurry.&nbsp; They bade him
&ldquo;make haste, for Grayson was badly wounded.&rdquo;&nbsp; They then
got into their carriage and told the coachman to drive back to
Liverpool.&nbsp; The other driver asserted he heard Captain Colquitt say,
&ldquo;by G---, it has done me good.&rdquo;&nbsp; The two gentlemen were
driven first to Mr. Ralph Benson&rsquo;s in Duke-street, to whom a message
was sent up that Mr. Sparling &ldquo;had been in the country and was quite
well.&rdquo;&nbsp; They next called on Mr. Stavert, when Mr. Sparling said,
&ldquo;I have put a ball into Grayson this morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Stavert replied, &ldquo;I hope he is not much hurt,&rdquo; when Mr.
Sparling exclaimed, &ldquo;I think not, for he made too much noise for it
to be of any consequence.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were next driven to the Royal
Hotel and thence to the Pier Slip, where a boat was in waiting, in which
they were rowed off.</p>
<p>Mr. Park, on hurrying forward to Knot&rsquo;s Hole, found Mr. Grayson
supported by his servant and Dr. MacCartney.&nbsp; His breeches were soaked
with blood at his right thigh.&nbsp; There appeared to be a shot-hole at
the upper part near the hip.&nbsp; He complained of being in acute pain,
and that he had lost the use of his limbs; he said he could no longer
stand, but must be allowed to sit down.&nbsp; The party, however, bore him
to the carriage, <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>and got him home as soon as possible.&nbsp; Mr.
Park attended him until he died.&nbsp; The ball had perforated the
thigh-bone, and was not extracted until after death.&nbsp; It was produced
in court.</p>
<p>Mr. Grayson was fully aware of his approaching end.&nbsp; On the
Wednesday after the duel, he told Mr. Park that &ldquo;he was going to meet
his God.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the following day he said that &ldquo;he hoped for
mercy, and that he might have gone with greater guilt on his head, if he
had killed Sparling, instead of Sparling killing him&rdquo;; and added,
&ldquo;whatever his opinions of Mr. Sparling&rsquo;s conduct might be, he
truly forgave him the injury he had done him, in giving him his
death-wound, and hoped, in the event of his decease, that his friends would
not prosecute him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Grayson repeatedly said Mr. Sparling
was an utter stranger to him, and that he did not know him even by
sight.</p>
<p>At that time counsel were not allowed to make any appeal to a jury for a
prisoner.&nbsp; Mr. Sparling&rsquo;s defence was therefore read by one of
his counsel, Mr. Park.&nbsp; It was very ably got up.&nbsp; He bitterly
protested against the outcry that had been made against him in public, from
the pulpit and by the press.&nbsp; He wholly denied bearing any malice
towards Mr. Grayson, and justified himself, declaring his act was a mere
vindication of his honour and good name, and that he had, in conjunction
with Captain Colquitt, repeatedly <!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>asked Mr. Grayson to withdraw his insulting
words and threatening speeches, but without avail, and the meeting was the
consequence of his obstinacy.&nbsp; He said of Mr. Grayson, as Mr. Grayson
had said of him, that he was an utter stranger to him.&nbsp; Captain
Colquitt made an able defence, wherein he justified himself and his
conduct.&nbsp; A number of gentlemen of high character and distinction
spoke to the kindliness of manner of Mr. Sparling at all times, and also of
Captain Colquitt, and completely exonerated them from the imputation of
entertaining vindictive or malevolent feelings.&nbsp; Amongst others who
appeared for Mr. Sparling were Sir Hungerford Hoskins, Captain Palmer, Rev.
Jonathan Brooks, His Worship the Mayor (William Harper, Esq.), Soloman
D&rsquo;Aguilar, Lord Viscount Carleton, Major-General Cartwright, Lord
Robert Manners, Lord Charles Manners, Lord James Murray, Colonel
M&rsquo;Donald, and Major Seymour.&nbsp; For Captain Colquitt many equally
honourable gentlemen and officers in His Majesty&rsquo;s service gave
evidence in his favour.</p>
<p>The judge on summing up decidedly leaned towards the prisoners, and the
result was a verdict of &ldquo;Not Guilty.&rdquo;&nbsp; The same jury was
afterwards empanelled to try Mr. Sparling, Captain Colquitt, and Dr.
MacCartney on another indictment, but no evidence being brought forward,
they were all acquitted.</p>
<p><!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>Thus terminated a trial which created an immense amount of
interest, not only in Liverpool, but throughout the whole of the northern
counties.</p>
<p>Before I relate the incidents of the second duel that took place in
Liverpool, I will briefly give the particulars of another affair, which
happened in the same year (July, 1804), which gave the gossips and <i>quid
nuncs</i> of the town ample food for conversation.&nbsp; This was the
court-martial on Captain Carmichael, the Adjutant of Colonel Earle&rsquo;s
regiment of Fusiliers, and formerly adjutant of Colonel Bolton&rsquo;s
regiment of &ldquo;Royal Liverpool Volunteers.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was charged
with &ldquo;disobedience of orders, and with addressing Colonel Earle in
abusive and scandalous language respecting the officers of the
regiment.&rdquo;&nbsp; The court-martial was held by virtue of a warrant
from His Royal Highness Prince William Frederick of Gloucester, the General
commanding the district.&nbsp; The president was Colonel Bolton; the
judge-advocate, Fletcher Raincock, Esq., barrister-at-law.</p>
<p>It appeared that on the 12th of June the Fusiliers were drilling on
Copperas-hill (fancy <i>our</i> Volunteers drilling on Copperas-hill!), at
the manual and platoon exercise, when they were commanded to &ldquo;order
arms&rdquo; and &ldquo;stand at ease&rdquo; by the Colonel; his intention
being <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>to keep the regiment for the remainder of the morning at firelock
exercise.&nbsp; Something was said of a private nature by Colonel Earle to
the Adjutant Carmichael, who, instead of replying, took no notice of the
observation.&nbsp; He subsequently spoke to the Colonel in an insulting and
impertinent manner, treating him at the same time with marked
indignity&mdash;calling out, loud enough for the men to hear, &ldquo;that
he insisted upon the officers being called together to inquire into his
conduct, for such things were said of him as he could not
bear.&rdquo;&nbsp; On being told that that was not the time nor place to
bring charges against the officers, and that he should put down in writing
what he had to say, and he would then be attended to, he did not seem
satisfied, but continued to demand the calling of the officers
together.&nbsp; Colonel Earle told him to go on with his duty.&nbsp;
Captain Carmichael still took no notice of these orders; but said his
feelings were &ldquo;worked up to a fiddle-string.&rdquo;&nbsp; Still
disobeying Colonel Earle&rsquo;s commands, he was told &ldquo;to go home if
he could not do his duty.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was then heard to say that the
officers, or some of the officers, were &ldquo;a set of
blacklegs.&rdquo;&nbsp; For this offence Captain Carmichael was
tried.&nbsp; He denied at first the right of the court to sit in judgment
upon him, and raised three objections, two of which were read, and the
third was stopped in <!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>the middle, being overruled by the court.&nbsp;
The court-martial sat five days, and the result of it was that Captain
Carmichael was acquitted of disobedience, but found guilty of addressing
abusive language to his commanding-officer.&nbsp; His sentence was
&ldquo;to be reprimanded at the head of his regiment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Colonel
Bolton was delegated to administer this reproof.&nbsp; Colonel Bolton spoke
highly in the Captain&rsquo;s favour, and stated that he had presented him
with a piece of plate which he had bought for him when in London, to mark
his respect for him, and his efficiency in drilling his (Colonel
Bolton&rsquo;s) regiment.</p>
<p>In the following year, 1805, the second duel was fought, which created
as great a sensation as that between Mr. Sparling and Mr. Grayson, in the
previous year.&nbsp; In this encounter the principals were Colonel Bolton
and Major Brooks, the same party who had caused the mischief in the
previously-mentioned affair.</p>
<p>The origin of the quarrel arose in this way:&mdash;Colonel Bolton, who
had raised a regiment of volunteers, in 1803, which he had entirely
clothed, armed, and equipped, mustering ten companies of sixty men each,
was held in high respect and possessed great influence with
government.&nbsp; On the death of Mr. Bryan Blundell, who held the
appointment of Customs Jerker, Colonel Bolton obtained the vacant office
for Major Brooks, who <!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>had been formerly in the Lancashire
Militia.&nbsp; After enjoying this place for a time, Major Brooks applied
for an increase of salary.&nbsp; His application was referred to the West
India Association, of which Colonel Bolton was President, to report upon
whether an increase in the pay of the office was desirable or
deserved.&nbsp; The Association reported adverse to Major Brooks&rsquo;
application.&nbsp; He immediately, publicly, and in the most disgraceful
manner, accused Colonel Bolton with being the cause of this refusal, as he
had learnt that the Colonel had said that &ldquo;&pound;700 a year was
quite income enough for a comparatively young, unmarried man.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Major Brooks, forgetting that Colonel Bolton&rsquo;s friendship and
influence had obtained for him, in the first instance, his appointment, did
his utmost to force his benefactor into collision with him, and to such an
extent was this annoyance carried, that at length a hostile meeting was
arranged between the parties.&nbsp; As a soldier and gentleman, Colonel
Bolton could no longer keep quiet.&nbsp; Major Brooks possessed,
unfortunately for himself, a great amount of irritable vanity and
pugnacity.&nbsp; He had been &ldquo;out,&rdquo; as it was then called, not
long before with Captain Carmichael, whose trial by court-martial I have
just detailed, upon some point of difference in military discipline.&nbsp;
The meeting took place on Bootle Sands, and, to show Major Brooks&rsquo;s
temper, <!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>on Captain Carmichael firing in the air, he exclaimed: &ldquo;D---
it, why don&rsquo;t you fire at me&mdash;we did not come here for
child&rsquo;s play!&rdquo;&nbsp; In those days duelling was very prevalent,
and small words brought out pistols and coffins for two.</p>
<p>The first meeting between Colonel Bolton and Major Brooks was to have
come off on the 20th December, 1804, at a place called Miller&rsquo;s Dam,
off the Aigburth-road, which, if I recollect rightly, was a small creek
which ran up to a mill&mdash;long and long ago swept away.&nbsp; The
circumstance of the quarrel, however, having by some means got abroad, the
authorities interposed and both gentlemen were arrested on their way to the
rendezvous.&nbsp; They were both bound over, in very heavy penalties, to
keep the peace to all and sundry of His Majesty&rsquo;s subjects, and each
other in particular, for twelve calendar months.&nbsp; Brooks, on being
arrested, exhibited the utmost rage and virulence, and expressed himself in
strong language against the Colonel, accusing him roundly of being the
cause of the arrest, and the interference they had met with.&nbsp; There
was not word of truth in this charge, Colonel Bolton, though forced into
the matter, according to the laws of honour, kept the meeting a secret, and
it was afterwards actually proved that the secret of the meeting oozed out
from one of Major Brooks&rsquo; own friends.</p>
<p><!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>During the twelve months the two gentlemen were bound over, Brooks
let slip no opportunity of insulting Colonel Bolton, as far as he dared
without coming into actual collision.&nbsp; He said he was the cause of
their meeting being interrupted, although he had been frequently assured of
the truth.&nbsp; As the twelve months were about to expire, Major Brooks
increased his violence.&nbsp; On the day the bond ceased to have effect,
the Major, meeting Colonel Bolton walking with Colonel Earle past the shop,
kept at present by Mr. Allender, in Castle-street, then and there publicly
again insulted him, and called him by a name which no gentleman could put
up with.&nbsp; A challenge was the consequence.&nbsp; The report of the
disturbance soon reached the Exchange, and the authorities again stepped
forward to prevent hostilities.&nbsp; Colonel Bolton was again arrested and
bound over, and Major Brooks was taken into custody.&nbsp; The latter
denied the right of the authorities to arrest him, asserting that he had
done nothing of sufficient weight to break his bond, and that he could not
be again bound over until the year of bondage had expired.&nbsp; The Major
was some hours in custody, but was at length released without promising
anything.&nbsp; He was no sooner at liberty than he sent a friend to
Colonel Bolton, who consented to a meeting for that very afternoon.&nbsp;
This was on the 20th <!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>of December, 1805.&nbsp; The place of
rendezvous on this occasion was in a field at the foot of Love-lane (now
called Fairclough-lane), which was skirted by it.&nbsp; The exact spot of
meeting was in a field about half-way between the present Boundary-street
(then a narrow lane with hedges) and St. Jude&rsquo;s Church.&nbsp; It was
near Fielding&rsquo;s nursery ground, which occupied the land now used as a
timber-yard.&nbsp; It was quite dark when the combatants arrived.&nbsp;
Major Brooks was accompanied Mr. Forbes.&nbsp; Mr. Park, surgeon, who
resided at the corner of Newington-bridge, was taken up by Colonel Bolton
on his way to the place of meeting in his carriage.&nbsp; Mr. Harris was
Colonel Bolton&rsquo;s second.&nbsp; When the parties got over into the
field it was found that they could not see to load the pistols.&nbsp; It
would then be about six o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Candles were therefore
procured to enable them to complete the necessary arrangements.</p>
<p>As soon as the combatants had taken the places allotted to them, Colonel
Bolton observed that, according to the laws of honour and duelling, the
Major was entitled to fire first.&nbsp; To this the Major assented, and
fired immediately, the shot passing harmlessly by the Colonel, who then
fired in his turn, hitting Major Brooks in the right eye.&nbsp; The Major
instantly fell and died.&nbsp; Colonel Bolton was hurried off and remained
in <!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>concealment for a short time.&nbsp; It was said that the firing of
the pistols was heard in Major Brooks&rsquo; house at the corner of
Daulby-street.&nbsp; An inquiry was held, when a verdict of wilful murder
was found, but in consequence of the strong recommendations of Major
Brooks&rsquo;s friends, admitting that he was entirely to blame, and that
his dreadful fate was entirely brought on by himself, the matter passed
over without further notice, everyone admitting that Colonel Bolton had
conducted himself with the utmost forbearance as well as courage, and that
he deserved the highest encomiums for his gentlemanly and straightforward
behaviour throughout this most painful affair.</p>
<h2><!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p>Some five years previous to this event, about the month of June, 1800, a
circumstance occurred which created a great sensation in the town, and
occupied public attention in a most remarkable degree.&nbsp; It seems
rather out of chronological order to go back five years; but the reader who
favours me with his attention must be content to obtain my information as I
can impart it.&nbsp; My head is not so clear as it used to be in the
arrangement of such matters.</p>
<p>In the year mentioned there was a merchant established in Liverpool of
the name of Wainwright, who was one of the actors in what nearly proved to
be a tragedy.&nbsp; At a place called Tunstall, near Burslem, in
Staffordshire, resided an earthenware manufacturer named Theophilus
Smith.&nbsp; This Smith was in difficulties and his affairs were in much
disorder.&nbsp; His creditors were <!-- page 100--><a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>hostile to him, and
he for some time had been endeavouring to obtain a settlement with
them.&nbsp; Amongst other creditors was Mr. Wainwright.&nbsp; He, however,
was not one of the hostile party, but was very well-disposed towards Mr.
Smith.&nbsp; One day, in the month of June, Mr. Wainwright received an
anonymous letter, requesting him to meet the writer at a small public-house
near the &ldquo;Olympic Circus,&rdquo; which was a temporary place of
amusement erected in Christian-street, then beginning to be built upon (the
Adelphi Theatre in Christian-street succeeded the Circus&mdash;in fact,
this place of amusement was called &ldquo;the Circus&rdquo; for many
years).&nbsp; Mr. Wainwright, on carefully examining the letter, fancied he
recognised Smith&rsquo;s handwriting, and resolved upon keeping the
appointment, supposing that Smith, fearing arrest, dared not openly wait
upon him.&nbsp; An arrest was an easy matter then.&nbsp; It was only
necessary to swear to a debt and take out a writ and you could arrest
anybody at a moment&rsquo;s notice, whether they actually owed you anything
or not.&nbsp; There used to be tough swearing in olden times.&nbsp; Mr.
Wainwright went to the house indicated and there, as he anticipated, found
Theophilus Smith.&nbsp; Mr. Wainwright concluded that Smith was about to
make some disclosures relative to his affairs and that was the reason he
had sent for him.&nbsp; But Smith only produced a printed statement of <!--
page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>his
accounts, which had been previously circulated, and made no new discovery
of any consequence; he, however, most strongly and earnestly entreated Mr.
Wainwright to accompany him to Tunstall, where, he said, on the following
afternoon, his creditors would meet, and where Mr. Wainwright&rsquo;s
presence would be conducive to their coming to terms.&nbsp; Mr. Wainwright
at first refused to accede to this request, having important business of
his own to attend to, but Smith was so importunate that he at length
consented to accompany him, and they set out on the same afternoon in a
chaise and pair.&nbsp; On their way, Smith was very friendly with Mr.
Wainwright, and conversed with him as any man would with a friendly
traveller on a long journey.&nbsp; On arriving within a mile of his house
at Tunstall, Mr. Smith ordered the chaise to be stopped, and got out, and
requested Mr. Wainwright to do the same, saying that a mile could be saved
by walking across some fields adjacent.&nbsp; Mr. Smith at the time
expressed his dread of being arrested if he were seen on the road along
which the chaise would have to be driven.&nbsp; Mr. Wainwright, however,
declined to get out; stating it was quite unnecessary to take so much
precaution; but at length, in consequence of Smith&rsquo;s earnest
entreaty, he consented.&nbsp; They then proceeded across the fields on
foot.&nbsp; As it was commencing to rain, <!-- page 102--><a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>Mr. Smith pressed on
Mr. Wainwright the use of his cloak; but this Mr. Wainwright
declined.&nbsp; Smith then led the way across the fields, by a stile path,
till they arrived at length at a small thicket, through which they
proceeded, when Smith stopped short, and said he knew a nearer way.&nbsp;
Smith then led Mr. Wainwright into a meadow, and standing before him drew
out a pistol.&nbsp; Mr. Wainwright immediately concluded that his
fellow-passenger intended to put an end to his own life, and, after a sharp
struggle, got the pistol from him, remonstrating with him upon the
wickedness of the act.&nbsp; Smith, however, drew another pistol, and fired
it at Mr. Wainwright, fortunately without effect.&nbsp; The latter
instantly sprang upon Mr. Smith and got him down, uttering loud cries for
assistance.&nbsp; Smith begged hard for mercy, and on promising not to
repeat his murderous attack, was allowed to get up.&nbsp; He was no sooner
released and on his legs than he drew a third pistol, fired, and hit Mr.
Wainwright in the body.&nbsp; The men again closed, when Smith drew a knife
and made several attempts upon his companion&rsquo;s life by attempting to
cut his throat, which was fortunately well protected by the thick rolls of
cambric it was then the custom to tie round the neck, as well as by a thick
scarf, which was cut through in several places.&nbsp; Mr. Wainwright,
however, never <!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>left hold of Smith until they reached his
house when, the door suddenly opening, he rushed in and quickly closed
it.&nbsp; He then came to the window and ordered Mr. Wainwright away,
refusing him shelter, although it was growing dark and raining
heavily.&nbsp; Mr. Wainwright contrived to crawl to a cottage, where he was
laid up for some time, but eventually recovered from the cuts and wounds
inflicted upon him.&nbsp; Smith absconded, and a reward of &pound;50 was
offered for his capture.&nbsp; This was effected after some time in Pall
Mall, London, by two Bow-street runners.&nbsp; Smith was committed for
trial at Stafford assizes, where he was found guilty and sentenced to be
hung.&nbsp; He, however, escaped that punishment by destroying both himself
and his wife in his cell in Stafford gaol, while awaiting his
sentence.&nbsp; What Smith&rsquo;s motive could be for his conduct no one
could conjecture.&nbsp; He would give no explanation on the subject though
pressed to do so.&nbsp; It was supposed that a sudden fit of insanity had
seized him, and that his violence was the result of it.&nbsp; During the
journey the two gentlemen were on the most friendly terms, taking their
meals together and acting as travellers thrown together usually do.&nbsp;
Mr. Wainwright&rsquo;s presence was most essential to Smith to allay the
hostility of his creditors, and therefore, the attempts to make away with
him were still more incomprehensible.</p>
<p><!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>As I sit by my fire-side with two or three old
friends&mdash;friends, indeed, for I have known them all for fifty, sixty,
and seventy years&mdash;we talk over old times, faces, scenes and places,
in a way that calls up the ghosts of the past to our dim eyes.&nbsp; If my
readers could listen to our stories of the old town they would hear more
about it in a night than my little amanuensis could write down in a
day.&nbsp; Many curious anecdotes and circumstances are called to
remembrance by us, and I must say we talk of old times with a regretful yet
pleasant feeling.&nbsp; I know I often startle some of my young friends by
telling them of scenes I have witnessed in the last century, and I have
often noticed them in their minds putting one year and another together, or
subtracting one from another so that they might ascertain whether I was
telling the truth or not.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe there is another man in Liverpool alive at this
time who saw the Town Hall on fire in 1795.&nbsp; I saw it, I may say,
almost break out, for I was in Castle-street in ten minutes after the alarm
had spread through the town, and that was soon done, for Liverpool was not
of the extent it is now.&nbsp; I believe half the inhabitants turned out
into the streets to witness that awful sight, although it was at five
o&rsquo;clock on a frosty Sunday morning in January.&nbsp; For my part, I
was aroused by the continuous springing of rattles by the <!-- page
105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>watchmen,
and the rushing sounds of people running along the street.&nbsp; I was soon
out of bed and joined the throng of people who were hurrying to the scene
of disaster.&nbsp; When I arrived there, a crowd had already
assembled.&nbsp; Castle-street was then very narrow.&nbsp; It was quite
choked up with people.&nbsp; Dale-street was beginning to be crowded while
High-street and Water-street were quite impassable.&nbsp; From the windows
of all the houses the terrified inmates were to be observed <i>en
dishabille</i>, and the large inn in Water-street, the Talbot, which was
nearly opposite the Town Hall, had people looking out at every window.</p>
<p>The smoke first made its appearance at the lower windows of the Town
Hall.&nbsp; The doors having been forced, a party of men got into the
interior of the building, and brought out for safety the books of the
various departments, and some of the town&rsquo;s officers having arrived,
something like system took the place of the dreadful confusion which
prevailed.&nbsp; The town records, the treasurer&rsquo;s accounts, and the
muniments, etc., were safely removed to a house at the end of
High-street.&nbsp; I helped to keep order.&nbsp; Assisted by many other
volunteers for the work we formed a lane so that there should be no
impediment to a quick removal of anything that was portable.&nbsp; The fire
was first discovered about five o&rsquo;clock in the morning by the
watchman on duty in the street.&nbsp; <!-- page 106--><a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>They were dull old
fellows, those watchmen, and of but little use, for in calling the hour
nine times out of ten they made a mistake.&nbsp; The thieves laughed them
to scorn.&nbsp; When the watchman saw smoke issuing from the windows he
gave the alarm without delay.&nbsp; The fire soon showed itself, when it
had once got ahead.&nbsp; When the new Exchange was erected, after the
former one had been taken down in 1748, somebody persuaded the authorities
to have the woodwork and timber of the new building steeped in a
composition of rosin and turpentine, so as to make the wood more
durable.&nbsp; It may therefore be readily imagined how inflammable such a
composition would make the wood, and how fiercely it burned when once
ignited.&nbsp; There had been a perceptible odour of some sort experienced
in the Exchange building for some days, and this was afterwards discovered
to have arisen from the woodwork under the council-chamber having taken
fire through a flue communicating from the Loan-office; and there is no
doubt it had been smouldering for days before it actually made its
appearance.&nbsp; It could not have been ten minutes after I arrived on the
spot before the flames burst out in all their fury.&nbsp; It was an awfully
grand sight.&nbsp; It was yet dark.&nbsp; What with the rushing and pushing
of the anxious crowd, the roaring of the fierce flames, and the calling of
distracted people, it was an event and <!-- page 107--><a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>scene never to be
forgotten.&nbsp; The building was soon all in a blaze, and nothing on earth
could have stopped that frightful conflagration.&nbsp; It was a mercy it
was a calm frosty morning or the houses in the four streets adjacent must
have caught the flame.&nbsp; From the age of these houses, the quantity of
timber in them, the narrowness of the streets, and the absence of a copious
supply of water, I am sure Liverpool would have been half consumed if a
wind had sprung up.&nbsp; I thought the building looked like a great
funeral pile as the flames roared out on all sides.&nbsp; It was a grand,
yet dreadful sight.&nbsp; The whole of Castle-street was occupied by
people, although, from the position of the Exchange, a full front view
could not be obtained, it being almost parallel with the west side of
Castle-street.&nbsp; The best view of it was where I stood at the top of
Dale-street, by Moss&rsquo;s bank.&nbsp; The dome, being constructed of
wood, soon took fire, was burnt, and fell in.&nbsp; We had not then as now
powerful engines, long reels of hose, and bands of active men well trained
to their arduous and dangerous duties, still, everybody did his best and
seemed desirous of doing something.&nbsp; We did that something with a
will, but without much order, system, or discretion.&nbsp; The engines in
use were not powerful, and the supply of water was not only tardy but
scanty, as you may believe when I tell you it had to be brought from <!--
page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>the
town wells, the Dye-house Well in Greetham-street, the Old Fall Well in
Rose-street (where Alderman&rsquo;s Bennett&rsquo;s ironwork warehouse
stands, near the corner of Rose-street&mdash;by the way, Rose-street was
called after Mr. Rose, who lived in the house next the Stork Hotel), and
the wells on Shaw&rsquo;s-brow; indeed, every possible source where water
could be obtained, was put in requisition.&nbsp; The inhabitants allowed
the rain-water to be taken from their water-butts in the vicinity to such
liberal extent that I verily believe there was not a drop of rain-water to
be got for love or money when that eventful day was out.&nbsp; Staid
housewives for many a day after complained of the dirt the trampling of
feet had made in their lobbies and yards, and deplored the loss of their
stores of soft-water.&nbsp; At that time water was precious, every drop
that could be obtained was saved, garnered, and carefully kept.&nbsp; Every
drop of hard-water we consumed had to be brought to our doors and paid for
by the &ldquo;Hessian&rdquo; or bucket.&nbsp; The water-carts were old
butts upon wheels, drawn by sorry horses and driven by fat old creatures,
half men half women in their attire and manners.&nbsp; The buckets were
made of leather and the water was sold at a halfpenny per Hessian.&nbsp;
They were so called, I believe, from their fancied resemblance to the
Hessian boots.&nbsp; You may judge how inadequate a supply of water we had
when our wants <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>were dependent upon such aid.&nbsp; The
water-carts came rumbling and tumbling along the streets, in many cases
losing one-half of their loads by the unusual speed at which they were
driven and the awkwardness of their drivers.&nbsp; Water was also carted
from the river, and I helped with others to push the carts up
Water-street.&nbsp; The steep ascent of this street in its badly paved
condition made this work extremely laborious.&nbsp; But everybody helped
and did what they could, and those who did nothing made up for deeds by
words and shouted and bawled and told the others what they ought to do.</p>
<p>Fortunately, only one life was lost, that of a fool-hardy young man who
would press forward to see the fire better&mdash;he rushed up to the
High-street door and a piece of timber fell on him.&nbsp; The surging of
the crowd caused several persons to be struck down and trampled upon.&nbsp;
I saved one woman&rsquo;s life by beating off the people who would have
crushed her.&nbsp; By twelve o&rsquo;clock the fire had slackened
considerably, and by the evening it was to all appearance subdued.&nbsp;
But the fire in the interior remained smouldering for some time
afterwards.&nbsp; In the churches on that day the event was alluded to in a
very feeling manner, and in St. Peter&rsquo;s Church the rector offered up
a prayer of thanksgiving that the town had been spared from a more
extensive calamity.</p>
<p><!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>At this time High-street (there was a famous tavern called the
&ldquo;Punch-Bowl&rdquo; in this street) was the communication between
Castle-street and Old Hall-street, and it is a most strange circumstance
that the direct line of road was not retained instead of cutting the new
street called Exchange-street East through the houses and gardens between
Tithebarn-street and Dale-street.&nbsp; It was a great mistake, and
everybody said so at the time.&nbsp; Many great mistakes have been made in
respect to our streets and public buildings, not the least of which was the
blunder of filling up the Old Dock, and erecting that huge and ugly
edifice, the Custom-house, thereon.</p>
<p>I believe if the conflagration had extended from the Exchange to some
distance in the adjoining streets, we should have had some vast
improvements effected.&nbsp; From the narrowness of Castle-street may be
imagined what a scene of confusion it must have been during the fire.&nbsp;
It is quite a wonder that many lives were not lost during that morning of
terror.&nbsp; The inhabitants of the four streets in many cases prepared
for flight, for the fire raged so fiercely at one time that the escape of
the houses in the vicinity from destruction seemed miraculous.&nbsp; While
I was helping to draw water from the yard of some people I knew in
Castle-street, a burning ember or piece of timber fell into a lot of dirty
paper which would <!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>in five minutes have been alight if I had not
been there to extinguish it.&nbsp; There were many such wonderful escapes
recorded.</p>
<p>The trial of Mr. Charles Angus for the alleged murder of Miss Margaret
Burns (who was his late wife&rsquo;s half-sister) in 1808, may be
considered as one of the <i>causes celebres</i> of the time.&nbsp; It took
place at Lancaster, on the 2nd of September, before Sir Alan Chambre.&nbsp;
Sergeant Cockle, and Messrs. Holroyd, Raine and Clark, were for the Crown;
Mr. T. Statham, attorney.&nbsp; Messrs. Topping, Scarlett, and Cross for
the prisoner; Mr. Atkinson, attorney.&nbsp; Mr. Angus was a gentleman of
Scotch birth, and resided in Liverpool&mdash;in King-street, I think.&nbsp;
He had been at one time an assistant to a druggist, where he was supposed
to have obtained a knowledge of the properties of poisons, and he was
charged with putting this knowledge to account in attempting to produce
abortion in the case of Miss Burns, who was suspected of being pregnant by
him, and thereby causing her death.&nbsp; Miss Burns was Mr. Angus&rsquo;s
housekeeper, and governess to his three children.&nbsp; The case rested
entirely on circumstantial evidence, made out against the prisoner by his
conduct previous to the supposed commission of the deed, by his conduct at
the time and afterwards.&nbsp; At the time the strongest prejudice ran
against Mr. Angus, and it must be said that the <!-- page 112--><a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>public were not
satisfied with the verdict of the jury; but at this distance of time, those
who had an opportunity of looking over the evidence, and remembering the
case in all its bearings, will at once say dispassionately that there was
not a shadow of evidence against Mr. Angus.&nbsp; Miss Burns, who had been
unwell for some time, was noticed previous to the 23rd of March, 1808, to
be ailing, and that her size had materially enlarged; and it was suspected,
as adduced by several witnesses, that she was <i>enceinte</i>.&nbsp; On the
23rd of March she complained of being very unwell, and went to lie down on
a sofa in the breakfast-room where she remained the whole of the day,
thirsting and vomiting.&nbsp; Mr. Angus would not allow his servants to sit
up with Miss Burns, but remained in the room with her the whole of that
night, the next day, and the following night.&nbsp; On the 25th Miss Burns
said she felt better.&nbsp; A servant on that morning was sent to
Henry-street for some Madeira that Miss Burns fancied.&nbsp; On her return,
not seeing the lady on the sofa, where an hour previous she had left her,
she looked round the room and discovered her doubled up in a corner of the
room with her face towards the wainscot, while Mr. Angus was asleep sitting
in a chair covered by a counterpane.&nbsp; The evidence was most
conflicting.&nbsp; Several witnesses declared Miss Burns was not pregnant,
others <!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>that they believed she was.&nbsp; The medical evidence was also
of a most bewildering and diverse nature.&nbsp; Some of the most eminent
surgeons in Liverpool were examined, and none of them agreed on the
case.&nbsp; This fact came out that no signs of childbirth were visible as
having taken place&mdash;no dead infant was discovered.&nbsp; The room in
which Miss Burns and Mr. Angus were, was at all times accessible to the
servants, and no cries of parturition were heard during the lady&rsquo;s
illness.&nbsp; The fact of the matter was, Miss Burns had suffered from an
internal complaint, and died from natural causes.&nbsp; This was shown by
Dr. Carson, then a young and rising physician at the time, and who
afterwards published a pamphlet in which he utterly demolished the medical
evidence given at the trial for the crown.</p>
<p>The jury, after a few minutes&rsquo; deliberation, returned a verdict,
finding the prisoner &ldquo;Not Guilty,&rdquo; on grounds as unimpeachable
as the trial.&nbsp; In some of the circumstances attending and resulting
from it, it was disgraceful, especially on the part of the medical
witnesses for the crown, in their conduct towards the one for the
defence&mdash;Dr. Carson.&nbsp; I have before me an authentic &ldquo;Report
of the Trial,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Vindication of their Opinions,&rdquo;
published by those witnesses, and Dr. Carson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Remarks&rdquo;
on that publication, in which he exposes their shortcomings with a
master&rsquo;s <!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>hand, in a style as terse as it is bold, and
as elegant as it is severe; never were the weapons of irony, satire, and
invective more effectively used; his impeachment is as withering as his
victory at the trial was complete.&nbsp; The authors of the
&ldquo;Vindications&rdquo; had not only done what in them lay to ruin him
in every conceivable way, public and private, but they had exposed
themselves to his &ldquo;Remarks,&rdquo; all-pungent as they were, by going
into court and giving opinions founded upon &ldquo;the most disgracefully
deficient dissection ever made.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sore which they had
inflicted upon themselves at the trial did not heal under the caustic of
the &ldquo;Remarks&rdquo;; and so the doctor became a victim to local
prejudice, passion, and persecution.&nbsp; But he gained to himself a
world-wide reputation which outlived them all; the honours of the French
Academy were bestowed upon him, and he took his stand among the literary
and scientific magnates of the day.&nbsp; As to the trial, the theory of
the prosecution was that the prisoner caused the lady&rsquo;s death by
administering a poison to procure abortion, and it was based upon a hole in
the coats of the stomach, and a peculiar mark in the uterus; the medical
witnesses for the crown affirming that the former could not have arisen
from any other known cause than poison, and the latter a sure sign of
recent delivery.&nbsp; No poison was found in the stomach <!-- page
115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>or
intestines, nor were the supposed contents of the uterus ever found, and no
other part of the body was examined.&nbsp; The hole in the stomach
presented the same appearance, and was described in the same terms as those
which John Hunter had called attention to as occurring in certain cases of
sudden death, where there was no suspicion of poisoning, and caused by the
action of the gastric juice.&nbsp; Doctor Carson accepted Hunter&rsquo;s
facts, but propounded a theory of his own, being guided to his conclusions
by the experiments of Sir John Pringle and Dr. Bride, in reference to water
at the temperature of 90 degrees dissolving animal substances.&nbsp; He
successfully combated the notion about poisoning from another point of
view, namely, the symptoms during life, the comparative mildness of which
did not correspond with the usual effects of the poison fixed upon.&nbsp;
As to the mark in the uterus, he gave his opinion that it might have arisen
from other causes than the one alleged; two phenomena were absent, and upon
this fact he asserted it to be physically impossible that there could have
been a recent delivery; and, moreover, in his &ldquo;Remarks,&rdquo; he
proved mathematically that the mark was four times the size it ought to
have been on that hypothesis.&nbsp; Miss Burns had not been attended
professionally by any one as she was averse to doctors.&nbsp; Mr. Angus in
his defence <!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>ascribed the whole of the legal proceedings against him to the
malevolence of two interested parties, and had it not now been for their
influence, the circumstance of Miss Burns&rsquo; death would have passed
over without remark.&nbsp; Mr. Angus, so far from desiring to harm Miss
Burns, expressed himself as deeply indebted to her for her care of his
children and the affection and attention to his comforts she had always
manifested, and emphatically declared he &ldquo;loved and respected her too
well to dream of doing her any harm.&rdquo;</p>

117</span>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p>When I look around and see the various changes that have taken place in
this &ldquo;good old town&rdquo; I am sometimes lost in wonderment.&nbsp;
Narrow, inconvenient, ill-paved streets have been succeeded by broad
thoroughfares&mdash;old tumble-down houses have been replaced by handsome
and costly buildings, while the poor little humble shops that once were
sufficient for our wants have been completely eclipsed by the gigantic and
elegant &ldquo;establishments&rdquo; of the present day.</p>
<p>I recollect Dale-street when it was a narrow thoroughfare, ill-paved and
ill-lighted at night.&nbsp; It was not half the present width.&nbsp; In
1808, as the town began to spread and its traffic increase, great
complaints were constantly being made of the inconvenience of the principal
streets, and it was agreed on all sides that something should be done
towards improvement.&nbsp; The first movement <!-- page 118--><a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>was made by widening
Dale-street; the improvement being by throwing the thoroughfare open from
Castle-street to Temple-court, but it really was not until 1820 that this
street was set out in anything like a bold and handsome manner.&nbsp; Great
difficulties were constantly thrown in the way of alterations by many of
the inhabitants, who had lived in their old houses, made fortunes under
their roofs, and were hoping to live and die where they had been born and
brought up.&nbsp; Many tough battles had the authorities to fight with the
owners of the property.&nbsp; Some were most unreasonable in the
compensation they demanded, while others for a time obstinately refused to
enter into any negotiations whatever, completely disregarding all promised
advantages.&nbsp; The most obtuse and determined man was a shoemaker or
cobbler, who owned a small house and shop which stood near
Hockenall-alley.&nbsp; Nothing could persuade him to go out of his house or
listen to any proposition.&nbsp; Out he would not go, although his
neighbours had disappeared and his house actually stood like an island in
the midst of the traffic current.&nbsp; The road was carried on each side
of his house, but there stood the cobbler&rsquo;s stall alone in its
glory.&nbsp; While new and comfortable dwellings were springing up, the old
cobbler laughed at his persecutors, defied them, and stood his ground in
spite of all entreaty.&nbsp; <!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>There the house stood in the middle of the
street, and for a long time put a stop to further and complete improvement,
until the authorities, roused by the indignation of the public, took
forcible possession of the place and pulled the old obnoxious building
about the owner&rsquo;s ears, in spite of his resistance and his fighting
manfully for what he thought were his rights; nor would he leave the house
until it had been unroofed, the floors torn up, and the walls crumbling and
falling down from room to room.&nbsp; The cobbler stuck to his old house to
the last, showing fight all through, with a determination and persistence
worthy of a nobler cause.&nbsp; Some few years ago a barber, also in
Dale-street, exhibited an equal degree of persistence in keeping possession
of his shop which was wanted for an improvement near Temple-street.&nbsp;
This man clung to his old house and shop until it was made utterly
uninhabitable..</p>
<p>Dale-street, when I was a boy, was not very much broader than Sir
Thomas&rsquo;s Buildings; in some parts it was quite as narrow, especially
about Cumberland-street end.&nbsp; The carrying trade at one time from
Liverpool was by means of packhorses, long strings of which used to leave
the town with their burthens, attended by their drivers, and always
mustered together in considerable number in Dale-street previous to
starting.&nbsp; This they did that they might be strong enough <!-- page
120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>to resist
the highwaymen who infested the roads at the end of the last century.&nbsp;
I have often heard my father talk of these free gentlemen&rsquo;s exploits,
and the sometimes droll adventures arising from their presence.&nbsp; He
used to tell a story of three volunteer officers going to Warrington by the
stage to a county muster, being stopped by a pretended footpad (a friend in
disguise) the other side of Prescot, and ignominiously robbed of everything
they possessed, even their very swords.&nbsp; I cannot say I believed the
story, because I felt sure no officers, whatever service they might be in,
would have allowed themselves to be so treated.&nbsp; My father frequented
the tavern which stood where Promoli&rsquo;s Bazaar now stands, and where
all the leading tradesmen used to assemble, and he told us that the three
officers were there one night and were terribly &ldquo;trotted&rdquo; about
their losses and that they did not altogether &ldquo;deny the soft
impeachment.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a good story current in Liverpool, I
have been told, in 1745, touching the doings of Mr. Campbell&rsquo;s
regiment which, when the rebellion broke out in that year, was suddenly
called into active service with orders to march to Manchester, by way of
Warrington, to resist a party of Scots said to be in that
neighbourhood.&nbsp; The regiment marched at night, and of course threw out
an advanced guard.&nbsp; When about two miles this side of Warrington, the
vanguard fell <!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>back reporting that they had seen a party of
the enemy bivouacking in the road about a quarter of a mile ahead, and that
they could see them quite plainly lying on the ground, at the sides and in
the middle of the road.&nbsp; A halt was called, and a council of war
summoned.&nbsp; Hearts beat quickly in some hardy frames who boldly advised
an onward march, while others were for retreating until some good plan of
attack could be determined upon.&nbsp; Some were for diverging from the
road and continuing the march through the lanes and bye-ways, so that, if
necessary, the enemy could be outflanked.&nbsp; One bolder than the rest
offered to go forward as a scout.&nbsp; His proposition was eagerly
accepted.&nbsp; Away he went, and soon in the distance a terrible uproar
was heard&mdash;the volunteers flew to arms, and waited in breathless
suspense.&nbsp; They were surprised, however, to hear the alarm raised, but
no shots fired.&nbsp; The row subsided, when presently the gallant scout
was seen approaching with a prisoner he had bravely captured&mdash;in the
form of a fat goose.&nbsp; The fact was that a flock of geese had got out
into the road, and they presented an appearance to the advanced guard of
troops bivouacking.&nbsp; The bold men of Liverpool were then led
undauntedly forward, and it was said that every other man marched into
Warrington with his supper on his knapsack.</p>
<p><!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>The most admirable improvements that the town underwent was when
Lord-street was widened and the Crescent formed, the completion of which
undertaking cost upwards of half a million of money.&nbsp; Castle-street
was narrow, badly paved, and badly lighted at night, as, indeed, was the
whole town.&nbsp; Yet, I recollect there were some people who objected to
the improvements at the top of Lord-street, who clung pertinaciously to the
old Potato Market, and the block of buildings called Castle Hill.&nbsp; The
houses that were erected upon the site of Castle Ditch had the floors of
some of their rooms greatly inclined in consequence of the subsidence of
the soil.&nbsp; There was a joke current at the time that these apartments
ought to be devoted to dining purposes, as the gravy would always run to
one side of the plate!</p>
<p>A great increase has taken place in the value of property in every part
of the town.&nbsp; In Castle-street sixty years ago a house and shop could
be had for &pound;30 per annum.&nbsp; The premises in which Roscoe&rsquo;s
Bank was carried on, and now occupied by Messrs. Nixon, were purchased by
Mr. Harvey who, finding his property remaining unoccupied for so long a
time, began to despair of letting it, and grew quite nervous about his
bargain.&nbsp; On the formation of Brunswick-street, projected in 1786,
this handsome thoroughfare was cut through Smock-alley <!-- page 123--><a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>and the houses in
Chorley-street, and swept away a portion of the old Theatre Royal in
Drury-lane; it then ran down to the old Custom-house yard, on the site of
which the Goree Piazzas and warehouses were erected.&nbsp; Drury-lane was
formerly called Entwhistle-street, after an old and influential family who
filled high offices in the town in their day.</p>
<p>Any one can fancy what Castle-street must have been when the market was
held in it, by filling Cable-street with baskets of farmers&rsquo; produce,
and blocking it up with all sorts of provisions and stalls, in which the
usual marketable commodities would be exposed for sale.</p>
<p>The introduction of Gas in the town was an immense stride in the march
of improvement; yet there were not a few persons who bitterly complained of
the Gas Company so often disturbing the streets to enable them to lay down
their pipes.&nbsp; Frequent letters appeared in the papers of the time to
that effect.&nbsp; Previous to 1817 the town was wretchedly lighted by oil
lamps which used to go out upon all trifling occasions and for insufficient
reasons.&nbsp; They only pretended to show light at the best of
times.&nbsp; The lamps were not lit in summer nor on moonlight
nights.&nbsp; They were generally extinguished by four or five
o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>
<p>The gentry were at one time attended by <!-- page 124--><a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>link-men or boys in
their night excursions.&nbsp; These links were stiff, tarred ropes about
the thickness of a man&rsquo;s arm.&nbsp; They gave a flaring light with
any quantity of bituminous-odoured smoke.&nbsp; In front of one or two of
the old houses of Liverpool I have seen a remnant of the link days, in an
extinguisher attached to the lamp iron.&nbsp; I think there is (or was) one
in Mount Pleasant, near the house with the variegated pebble pavement in
front (laid down, by the way, by a blind man).&nbsp; The link-extinguisher
was a sort of narrow iron funnel of about six inches in diameter at the
widest end.&nbsp; It was usually attached to a lamp-iron, and was used by
thrusting the link up it, when the light was to be put out.</p>
<p>People in those days seldom went out at night without a lantern, for
what with the ruggedness of the pavements and the vile state of the roads
it was by no means safe to life or limb to go without some mode of
illuminating the way.</p>
<p>Gas was introduced in 1816 and 1817.&nbsp; Only one side of
Castle-street was lighted at first.&nbsp; While we now acknowledge the
invaluable introduction of this fluid, when we consider the vast area over
which it casts its pleasant and cheerful beams, and the price we also pay
for such an unmistakable comfort and blessing, we shall not fail to peruse
the first advertisement of the Gas Company with intense interest.&nbsp;
With this belief <!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>I insert a copy of it.&nbsp; The rate of
charge and the mode of ascertaining the quantity of light consumed cannot
but prove curious to us and rather puzzling perhaps to understand.</p>

<p>Lord-street, previous to 1827, was very narrow; it was not so wide even
as Dale-street.&nbsp; The houses and all the streets in Liverpool were just
as we see in third-rate country towns, having bowed shop-windows, or square
ones, projecting from the side of the house.&nbsp; I recollect
Church-street and Ranelagh-street being paved in the centre only.&nbsp;
Cable-street, Redcross-street and Park-lane were only flagged in 1821; and
nearly all the houses in these streets were then private dwellings.&nbsp;
In Ranelagh-street the houses had high steps to the front doors.&nbsp; The
porches of the old houses in Liverpool were remarkable for their handsome
appearance and patterns.&nbsp; Many still remain but they are yearly
decreasing in number.&nbsp; I recollect when the only shops in
Church-street were a grocer&rsquo;s (where part of Compton House now
stands) and a confectioner&rsquo;s at the corner of Church-alley.&nbsp;
Bold-street was nearly all private houses, and there were very few shops in
it, even some forty years ago.&nbsp; Seventy years since there was scarcely
a house of any sort in it.&nbsp; I have been told that where the
Athen&aelig;um now stands in Church-street, there was once a large pond on
which the skaters used to cut a figure, and that a farm-house stood at the
corner of Hanover-street.&nbsp; Some houses in Hanover-street <!-- page
127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>will be
noticed as being built out at angles with the street.&nbsp; This was to
secure a good view of the river from the windows.&nbsp; At the corner of
Bold-street some ninety years ago was a milkman&rsquo;s cottage and
dairy.&nbsp; Whitechapel, when I was a lad, was a dreadful
thoroughfare.&nbsp; I have seen it deep in water, and boats rowed about,
conveying people from house to house, in times of flood.&nbsp; There used
to be a channel with water running down the centre of the street, which was
considerably lower than it is at present.&nbsp; It was no uncommon thing
for the cellars of all the houses to be filled with water, and even now, I
believe, some portion of the neighbourhood is not unfrequently rendered
damp and uncomfortable.&nbsp; In the cellars under the Forum, in
Marble-street, there is a very deep well which is at all times full; this
well drains the premises.&nbsp; This Forum, about fifty years ago, was a
well-known and much frequented arena for disputations of all sorts.&nbsp;
Many a clever speaker has addressed audiences now passed away.&nbsp;
Speaker and spoken to are for the most part gone.&nbsp; A great change took
place some forty years ago in the locality where St. John&rsquo;s Market
now stands.&nbsp; There was a ropewalk here which extended from where the
angle of the building faces the Amphitheatre, as far as
Renshaw-street.&nbsp; There was a field at one time to the north of the
ropery skirted by hedges <!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>which went down the site of the present
Hood-street, and round to where there is now a large draper&rsquo;s shop in
the Old Haymarket; the hedge then went up John&rsquo;s-lane, and so round
by the site of the lamp opposite the Queen&rsquo;s Hotel, along
Limekiln-lane to Ranelagh-street.&nbsp; These were all fields, being a
portion of what was anciently called &ldquo;the Great Heath.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It was at one time intended to erect a handsome Crescent where the
cab-stand is now.&nbsp; The almshouses stood on this ground.&nbsp;
Limekiln-lane, now Lime-street, was so called from the limekiln that stood
on the site of the present Skelhorn-street.&nbsp; Here were open fields,
which extended to the London-road, quite famous for the assembling of all
sorts of rough characters, especially on summer evenings, and on
Sundays.&nbsp; Cock-fighting, dog-fighting, and pugilistic encounters used
to be carried on daily, and scenes of the utmost confusion took place,
until public murmurings compelled the authorities to keep order.&nbsp; It
was in the fields about where the Lord Nelson-street rooms stand, that my
grandfather recollects seeing three, if not four, men hung for being mixed
up in the rebellion of &rsquo;45.&nbsp; They were hung there in chains for
some time, and afterwards buried at the foot of the gallows as a warning to
evil-doers.</p>
<p>There were several mills in this vicinity, one of which was called the
White Mill, and there was a <!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>very curious story once commonly current about
it, in the town to the effect that the owner of it had been murdered by a
friend of his who kept a mill lower down the hill.&nbsp; Whitemill-street
is called after this White Mill.&nbsp; The lower mill stood where
Hotham-street is now, which formerly was called Duncan-street.&nbsp; The
mill occupied the site of the Quaker&rsquo;s school, which was pulled down
to make room for the railway yard.&nbsp; When this mill was razed to the
ground, a grave was discovered in the foundation, in which was a skeleton,
and it was freely said that this was the White Mill miller, who had so
mysteriously disappeared some years previously.&nbsp; It was the talk of
the town at the time, and crowds of persons went to the spot to look at the
grave.&nbsp; When the mill in Duncan-street was taken down it was so rotten
that it was razed to the ground in one day.&nbsp; Where St. George&rsquo;s
Hall now stands was the Infirmary.&nbsp; It faced Islington Triangle,
afterwards converted into a market-place, being built round with small
shops, having a pump in the middle.&nbsp; When this market was discontinued
in 1848, the tenants were removed to Gill-street, on its opening in
September of that year.&nbsp; The Infirmary consisted of two wings and a
centre; at the back was a spacious garden or airing ground.&nbsp; On
Shaw&rsquo;s Brow lived the potters.&nbsp; There were upwards of 2,000
persons engaged in this trade, <!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>which was carried on to a very great
extent.&nbsp; Pottery in Liverpool was a considerable manufacture, and it
is said that it was Mr. Sadler, a potter who lived in Harrington-street,
that first discovered the art of printing upon earthenware, through seeing
his children stick pieces of printed cotton fabric on some damaged plates
they were playing with.&nbsp; There were many other large potteries in
Liverpool at one period, besides those on Shaw&rsquo;s Brow.&nbsp; There
was one at the corner of Fontenoy-street, of which Alderman Shaw was
proprietor.&nbsp; There was one at the bottom of Duke-street.&nbsp; This
was kept by Mr. Drinkwater, who married Captain Leece&rsquo;s daughter,
after whom Leece-street is named.&nbsp; Pothouse-lane is a reminder of the
old trade.&nbsp; There were other potteries on Copperas-hill.&nbsp; I do
not recollect much about these potteries; but I have heard my father and
mother talk about them amongst their &ldquo;Recollections.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This trade seems to have departed from this town most strangely.&nbsp; The
last remnant of it was in the works that were in operation down by the
river-side near the present Toxteth Docks.&nbsp; Watch-making has always
been a great trade in Liverpool.&nbsp; The first introducer of it was Mr.
Wyke, who lived in Dale-street, on the site of the present public
offices.&nbsp; Mr. Wyke came from Prescot, and carried on a large trade in
watches about the year 1758.&nbsp; Mr. Litherland, the <!-- page 131--><a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>inventor of the
chronometer, died in Church-street.&nbsp; On Mr. Wyke&rsquo;s premises and
garden the Gas Works were afterwards erected, which were removed to
Newington some few years ago.&nbsp; Amongst many others I have seen some
very remarkable changes that have taken place about Bevington-hill.&nbsp; I
recollect very well what is now called &ldquo;Summer Seat&rdquo; being
gardens, and the view from them to the river quite uninterrupted.&nbsp;
There was near them a house built by a shoemaker who had made a fortune by
his trade; it was called &ldquo;Lapstone Hall.&rdquo;&nbsp; The inn called
the &ldquo;Bush&rdquo; had a bough hanging out with the motto &ldquo;Good
Wine Needs no Bush.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sailors were very fond of going up to
Bevington-Bush on Sundays with their sweethearts, and many a boisterous
scene have I witnessed there.&nbsp; The view was really beautiful from the
gardens.&nbsp; Where the market stands in Scotland-road there used to be a
large stone quarry.&nbsp; The houses in Scotland-road beyond the market are
all of very late erection.&nbsp; I can well recollect open fields and
market gardens thereabouts, and, indeed, all the way up where Scotland-road
now is, there used to be fields.&nbsp; The Preston-road wound round up
Bevington-Bush.&nbsp; The Everton range looked very pretty from the
Kirkdale-road, especially when handsome mansions began to dot its
crest.&nbsp; I recollect along this road cornfields, meadows and
gardens.&nbsp; <!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>Scotland-road is a comparatively newly-formed
thoroughfare.&nbsp; Any one turning to the left at the bottom of
Scotland-road, and going to Bevington-Bush will see, in those old houses on
the right hand, of what Liverpool, in my young days, was composed.&nbsp;
Very few specimens of the old town houses are now remaining, so speedily do
they become modernized and altered.&nbsp; I like those quaint old buildings
although they were not very comfortable within, from their narrow windows
and low ceilings, but there has been a great deal of mirth and jollity in
some of those old low-roofed houses in the town, in our great privateering
and slave-dealing times.</p>
<p>I have often heard old people talk about <i>their</i>
&ldquo;Recollections&rdquo; of the town.&nbsp; I have heard them speak of
Clayton-square being laid out in the memorable year of 1745.&nbsp; Mrs. or
Madame Clayton to whose family this part of the town chiefly belonged, was
the daughter of Mr. Clayton who was Mayor in 1689, and who represented the
town in parliament for eight sessions.&nbsp; Madame Clayton&rsquo;s house
stood near Cases-street.&nbsp; Her garden was said to have been the best
kept and most productive in the town.&nbsp; It was this lady who started
the first private carriage in Liverpool.&nbsp; I have heard it said that
people used to stare at it, as if it was something wonderful.&nbsp; The
streets about Church-street are all called after the old <!-- page 133--><a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>families.&nbsp;
Parker-street was called after Mr. Parker, of Cuerdon, who married Miss Ann
Clayton.&nbsp; Their daughter Jane married one of the Tarletons.&nbsp;
Tarleton-street is named after Colonel Banastre Tarleton.&nbsp;
Banastre-street is named after him also.&nbsp; Houghton-street is after the
old Houghton family.&nbsp; Williamson-square was laid out in 1745 by Mr.
Williamson.&nbsp; Basnett-street was called after the Basnetts, at one time
a very influential family of old Liverpool; Leigh-street after the Leighs;
Cases-street after the Cases.&nbsp; Mr. Rose, who projected many streets at
the north end of the town on his extensive property, seems to have adopted
the poets&rsquo; names to distinguish his thoroughfares, as in Chaucer, Ben
Jonson, Juvenal, Virgil, Dryden, Milton, Sawney (Alexander) Pope-street,
etc.&nbsp; Meadows-street, Scotland-road, was named after Mr. William
Meadows, who married six wives.&nbsp; His first wife lived two years.&nbsp;
He next married Peggy Robinson, who lived twenty years, and bore him
children; after being a widower a month, he again married.&nbsp; This wife
lived two years.&nbsp; After remaining a widower seven weeks, he married
his fourth wife, who lived eighteen years.&nbsp; After a nine months&rsquo;
single blessedness he again married.&nbsp; After his fifth wife&rsquo;s
death he remained a widower thirty-four weeks, and at the age of
seventy-five, on the 10th of June, 1807, he married Miss Ann <!-- page
134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>Lowe, of
Preston-street.&nbsp; William Meadows was thought to be a bold man.&nbsp;
Maguire-street was named after Mr. Maguire who kept a shop in
Lord-street.&nbsp; Benson-street was called after Moses Benson, Esq.&nbsp;
Bixteth-street after Alderman Bixteth, who is said &ldquo;to have been
publicly thanked by the authorities for paving the front of his house with
his own hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pudsey-street after Pudsey Dawson.&nbsp;
Seel-street after Mr. Seel, who lived at the corner of it.&nbsp;
Wolstenholme-square and street, after an influential family of that
name.&nbsp; Bold-street after the Bolds, who built the first house in it:
now occupied by Mr. Dismore.&nbsp; Colquitt-street after the Colquitts,
whose mansion was converted into the Royal Institution.&nbsp; Berry-street,
was named after Captain Berry, who built the first house at the corner of
Bold-street.&nbsp; Cropper-street after the Cropper family.&nbsp;
Fazakerly-street after the Fazakerlys.&nbsp; Oakes-street after Captain
Oakes, who died in 1808.&nbsp; Lydia Ann-street after Mademoiselle Lydia
Ann De La Croix, who married Mr. Perry, the originator of Fawcett&rsquo;s
foundry, and the Coal Brook Dale iron works.&nbsp; Mason-street, Edge-hill,
was named after Mr. Mason, who built and endowed Edge-hill church, and
whose mansion stood at the corner of Mason-street, the gardens of which
extended to the bottom of Paddington.&nbsp; James-street was named after
Mr. Roger James, who held large property <!-- page 135--><a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>in it.&nbsp;
Preeson&rsquo;s-row was named after Alderman Preeson, who built his house
and two others of the old Castle materials.&nbsp; Part of Castle-street is
also constructed of the timbers and stones.&nbsp; Old Peter-street which
ran out of School-lane has disappeared.&nbsp; Crosshall-street was called
after the Hall and gardens of the Crosses which stood on the site of (or
about) Manchester-street.&nbsp; Part of Fenwick-street was called Dry
Bridge, a bridge passing over the Old Ropery, the name of which is
perpetuated in that street.&nbsp; Holden&rsquo;s Weint was re-named
Brook-street.&nbsp; Lower Stanley-street was re-named Button-street, after
Mr. Button, who lived to a great age, and saw I don&rsquo;t know how many
king&rsquo;s reigns.&nbsp; The streets of Liverpool seem to have been
named, in some parts of the town, as it were, in classes, as I have
mentioned.&nbsp; Mr. Rose called his new thoroughfares after the poets, and
in another neighbourhood we find the names of celebrated commanders
affording street-titles as in Blake-street, Duncan-street (afterwards
Hotham-street), Clarence-street, Russell-street,&nbsp; Rodney-street,
Seymour-street, Rupert-street, etc.&nbsp; While on the site of the old
Botanic Gardens at the top of Oxford-street, we find Laurel-street,
Grove-street, Oak, Vine, and Myrtle-streets.&nbsp; In Kensington, on the
site of Dr. Solomon&rsquo;s property, we have streets named after
celebrated lawyers, and this locality is jocosely called
&ldquo;Judge&rsquo;s <!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>Land.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have streets thereabout
bearing the names of Cottenham, Coltman, Wightman, Patteson, Pollock, and
Coleridge, and there may also be found a Gilead and a Solomon-street.</p>
<p>By the way, a reference to Dr. Solomon&rsquo;s property, at Kensington,
reminds me of the good stories that were current in Liverpool about the
worthy doctor himself.&nbsp; I recollect one wherein the laugh was loud at
the Custom-house authorities, who had been nicely bitten by a seizure they
had made of some of the doctor&rsquo;s &ldquo;exports.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was
said that a quantity of &ldquo;Balm of Gilead,&rdquo; upon which drawback
was claimed, had been seized by the Custom-house people as not being of the
specified value to entitle Dr. Solomon to claim so large an amount of
drawback.&nbsp; The doctor was, as may be supposed, very wrath at his
&ldquo;goots&rdquo; being waylaid, but he determined upon revenge.&nbsp;
Making up a lot of sugar and water, well-flavoured with spice, the doctor
entered a large case &ldquo;outward,&rdquo; declaring it to be of the same
value as the former seized case.&nbsp; The trap fell, and the Custom-house
authorities were caught, to the intense satisfaction of the doctor, who
told them he &ldquo;vould teach them to seize his goots!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another story is told of the doctor once entertaining a party of
gentlemen at Gilead House (as was often his custom), and towards the close
of the <!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>evening, some one began joking the doctor about his &ldquo;Balm
of Gilead.&rdquo;&nbsp; The doctor bore the jesting very well, and on being
told he ought to let those present taste it, readily consented to open a
few bottles.&nbsp; Now this Balm, I believe, was very good, and was made,
it was said, of strong alcohol or brandy, and the richest spices.&nbsp; The
bottles of &ldquo;Balm&rdquo; passed round and were duly appreciated.&nbsp;
On the guests preparing to leave, they were presented with &ldquo;a little
bill&rdquo; amounting to about a guinea each for the Balm of Gilead which
had been consumed.&nbsp; The doctor telling them that it was by means of
the &ldquo;Balm&rdquo; he lived, and through the &ldquo;Balm&rdquo; he was
enabled to invite them to partake of his really bountiful
hospitality.&nbsp; Each guest paid his bill, admitting that the doctor was
right, and that they had merited the reproof so properly administered to
them.</p>
<p>The doctor used to drive a handsome team of four horses, and, of course,
attracted a good deal of attention whenever he made his appearance in the
streets.&nbsp; On one occasion the late Lord Sefton, who was through life a
first-rate whip, drove up to Heywood&rsquo;s bank in his usual dashing
style.&nbsp; Dr. Solomon was tooling along behind his lordship, and
desirous of emulating his mode of handling the reins and whip, gave the
latter such a flourish as to get the lash so firmly fixed round <!-- page
138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>his neck as
to require his groom&rsquo;s aid to release him from its folds.</p>
<p>I will now give the derivations of a few more streets, as I have heard
them spoken of by old people; they may be interesting to my readers:

1697.&nbsp; He resided in Pool-lane, now South Castle-street; his garden
occupied this locality.&nbsp; Atherton-street was named after Mr. Peter
Atherton, who was bailiff, in 1673.&nbsp; Bird-street was named after Mr.
Joseph Bird, who was bailiff, in 1738; mayor in 1746.&nbsp; In Birch-field
resided Mr. Birch.&nbsp; Roscoe lived here at one time, and it was here he

recollect a great many fine trees being in and about this vicinity.&nbsp;
Bolton-street was named after John Bolton, Esq., or Colonel Bolton as he
was called.&nbsp; Byrom-street was named after Octavius Byrom.&nbsp;

Church.&nbsp; This street was originally called Tarleton&rsquo;s
New-street.&nbsp; Shaw-street was named after &ldquo;Squire Shaw,&rdquo;
who held much property at Everton.&nbsp; Sir Thomas&rsquo;s Buildings is
called after Sir Thomas Johnson, who, when Mayor, benevolently caused St.
James&rsquo;s Mount to be erected as a means of employing the destitute
poor in the severe winter of 1767.&nbsp; Strand-street derived its name
from being the strand or shore of the river.&nbsp; Hunter-street and South
Hunter-street, Maryland-street, Baltimore-street, etc., were named after

140</span>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p>In 1801, my wife being out of health, I was advised to take her from
town.&nbsp; As Everton was recommended by Dr. Parks, I looked about in that
neighbourhood, and after some difficulty obtained accommodation in a neat
farm-house which stood on the rise of the hill.&nbsp; I say it was with
difficulty that I could meet with the rooms I required, or any rooms at
all, for there were so few houses at Everton, and the occupants of them so
independent, that they seemed loth to receive lodgers on any terms.&nbsp;
It must appear strange to find Everton spoken of as being &ldquo;out of
town,&rdquo; but it was literally so then.&nbsp; It was, comparatively
speaking, as much so as West Derby, or any of the neighbouring villages
round Liverpool, are at present.</p>
<p>The farm-house in which we resided has long since been swept away, with
its barns, its piggery, and its shippon.&nbsp; Never more will its
cornricks gladden <!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>the eye&mdash;never more will busy
agricultural life be carried on in its precincts.&nbsp; Streets and courts
full of houses cumber the ground.&nbsp; No more will the lark be heard over
the cornfield&mdash;the brook seen running its silvery course&mdash;or the
apple in the orchard reddening on the bending bough.&nbsp; The lark is
represented by a canary in a gilded cage hanging out of a first-floor
window&mdash;the corn-field by the baker&rsquo;s shop, with flour at eight
pounds for a shilling&mdash;the brook is a sewer, and the apple is only
seen at the greengrocer&rsquo;s shop at the corner, in company with
American cheese, eggs, finnon-haddies, and lucifer matches.&nbsp; Ditch and
hedge&mdash;the one with waving sedges and &ldquo;Forget-me-nots&rdquo; the
other with the May blossom loading the evening air with its balmy
breath&mdash;were as prevalent, at the time I speak about, in Everton, as
you will now find in any country district.&nbsp; It was a pleasant place in
summer and autumn time.&nbsp; The neighbourhood of the Beacon was our
favourite resort.&nbsp; Many a pleasant day we have spent at the top of
it.&nbsp; The hill was covered with heather and gorse bushes.&nbsp; In
winter it was as wild, bleak, and cold a place as any you could meet
with.</p>
<p>In the summer it was the delight of holiday-makers.&nbsp; A day&rsquo;s
&ldquo;out&rdquo; to the Beacon, at Everton, was a very favourite
excursion.&nbsp; The hill-side on Sundays used to be thronged with merry
people, <!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>old and young.&nbsp; The view obtained from Everton Beacon-hill
was a view indeed.</p>
<p>And what a prospect!&nbsp; What a noble panoramic scene!&nbsp; I never
saw its like.&nbsp; I do not think, in its way, such an one existed
anywhere to be compared with it.&nbsp; At your feet the heather commenced
the landscape, then came golden corn-fields and green pasture-lands, far
and wide, until they reached the yellow undulating sand-hills that fringed
the margin of the broad estuary, the sparkling waters of which, in the glow
and fulness of the rich sunshine, gave life and animation to the scene, the
interest of which was deeply enhanced, when on a day of high-tide, numbers
of vessels might be seen spreading their snowy canvas in the wind as they
set out on their distant and perilous voyages.&nbsp; In the middle ground
of the picture was the peninsula of Wirral, while the river Dee might be
seen shimmering like a silver thread under the blue hills of Wales, which
occupied the back ground of the landscape.&nbsp; Westward was the
ocean&mdash;next, the Formby shore attracted the eye.&nbsp; The sand-hills
about Birkdale and Meols were visible.&nbsp; At certain seasons, and in
peculiar states of the atmosphere, the hummocks of the Isle of Man were to
be seen, while further north Black Combe, in Cumberland, was
discernible.&nbsp; Bleasdale Scar, and the hills in Westmoreland, dimly
made out the extreme distance.&nbsp; Ashurst <!-- page 143--><a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>Beacon, Billinge, and
at their back Rivington-pike, were visible.&nbsp; Carrying the eye along
the Billinge range, there were Garswood-park, Knowsley and Prescot; the
smoke from the little town of St. Helen&rsquo;s might have been seen behind
them.&nbsp; Far away to the eastward were the Derbyshire-hills.&nbsp; Then
we saw those of Shropshire, until the eye rested on the Chester ranges,
Beeston and Halton Castles being plainly before us.&nbsp; The old city of
Chester was discernible with a good glass.&nbsp; The eye moved then along
the Welsh hills until it rested on the Ormeshead and travelled out upon the
North sea.&nbsp; Below us, to our left, was the town of Liverpool, the
young giant just springing into vigorous life and preparing to put forth
its might, majesty and strength, in Trade, Commerce, and Enterprise.&nbsp;
The man of 1801 can scarcely believe his eyes in 1862.&nbsp; The distant
view is still there, from the top of Everton church tower, but how
wonderfully is all the foreground changed.</p>
<p>The Beacon stood on the site of the eastern corner of Everton
church.&nbsp; It was a square tower of two stories, and approached from the
present Church-street by a little lane.&nbsp; Church-street was then a
sandy winding road, having on one side the open heathery-hill, and on the
other a low turf wall which enclosed the fields called &ldquo;the
Mosses,&rdquo; which were indeed little better than marshes.&nbsp; The
Beacon was constructed of the <!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>red sandstone taken from the vicinity.&nbsp; I
am no antiquarian, so that I can give but a poor opinion of its original
date of erection.&nbsp; It was said by some to have been of great
age&mdash;long previous to the time of Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp; Some even
ascribed it to the time of the Earl of Chester; but a learned friend of
mine once told me, when talking on this subject, that that could not have
been the case, as Beacons were not erected in tower shapes until after the
time of Edward the Third.&nbsp; Beacons, previously to that period, were
merely lighted fires in cressets, grates, baskets of large size, or of
faggots piled up.&nbsp; Everton Beacon certainly looked very old and
dilapidated, and had stood the shock and buffet of some centuries.&nbsp;
Its size was about six yards square; its height twenty-five feet.&nbsp; The
basement floor was on a level with the ground, and was a square room in
which there was, in one corner, a fireplace, much knocked about and
broken.&nbsp; There was also a flight of narrow stone steps which led to
the upper chamber.&nbsp; It was utterly bare of any fittings whatever; but
in the walls were indications of there having been fixtures at some
time.&nbsp; There being no door to it the cattle which grazed on the hill
had access to it at all times of storm or wind or heat, or as their bovine
inclinations should prompt them to seek shelter, so that the floor, which
was unflagged, <!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>was always in a very dirty state.&nbsp; On
ascending the stairs access was obtained to the upper apartment which was
lighted by a broad window facing the westward.&nbsp; This room had been
used as a sleeping apartment by the guard or custodian of the Beacon, the
window serving as a look-out.&nbsp; I believe the combustibles used in
lighting up the signals were stored in it, the lower room being occupied as
the common living chamber.&nbsp; From the upper room a flight of stone
steps led upon the roof or outer platform.&nbsp; In the south-west corner
was a large stone tank in which the signal fires were lighted.&nbsp; It
seemed to have been subjected to the action of intense heat.&nbsp; At one
corner was a sort of pent-house which served as a shelter for the watchman
in inclement weather.&nbsp; On the east wall a gooseberry bush flourished
surprisingly.&nbsp; How it came there no one knew&mdash;it had long been
remembered in that position by every one who knew anything about the
Tower.&nbsp; A few years previous to the date I speak about, the Beacon was
occupied by a cobbler who carried on his trade in it, and eked out a living
by grazing a cow and some goats on the common land in the vicinity.&nbsp;
He looked after them while he made, mended, or cobbled.&nbsp; It was a very
current tradition in Everton that during the early part of the reign of
Charles the First, people came up to Everton Beacon to be married, during
the <!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>proscription of the clergy.&nbsp; When Thurot&rsquo;s expedition
was expected in 1760, it was said that Everton Hill was alive with people
from the town waiting the freebooters&rsquo; approach.&nbsp; A party of
soldiers was then encamped on the hill, and I have been told the men had
orders, on Thurot&rsquo;s appearance, to make signals if by day, and to
light up the Beacon if at night, to communicate the intelligence of the
French fleet being off the coast to the other Beacons at Ashurst and
Billinge, Rivington-pike and elsewhere, and so spread the news into the
north; while signals would also be taken up at Halton, Beeston, the Wreken,
and thence to the southward.&nbsp; The most perfect arrangements for the
transmission of this intelligence are said to have been made; and I knew an
old man at Everton who told me that he had on that occasion carted several
loads of pitch-barrels and turpentine and stored them in the upper chamber
of the Beacon to be ready in case of emergency.&nbsp; He said that during
the French war, at the close of the reign of George the Second, the Beacon
was filled with combustibles, and that there was a guard always kept
therein.</p>
<p>I am not sure if it is very generally known that it was to a Liverpool
captain the discovery of the sailing of the Armada must be ascribed, and
through him was made public in England.&nbsp; This captain&rsquo;s name was
Humphrey Brook.&nbsp; He was <!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>outward bound from Liverpool to the Canaries
when he saw the Spanish fleet in the distance, sailing north.&nbsp;
Suspecting its errand he put his helm up and hastened back to Plymouth,
where he spread the intelligence and caused it to be transmitted to
London.&nbsp; He received substantial marks of favour from the Government
for his foresight, prudence, and activity.</p>
<p>In 1804 a telegraph station was established at Everton.&nbsp; It stood
where the schools are now built.&nbsp; It was discontinued in 1815.&nbsp;
It consisted of an upright post whence arms extended at various
angles&mdash;there was also a tall flag-staff for signals.&nbsp; While we
were at Everton, a Mr. Hinde erected a house at the corner of Priory-lane,
which he intended should represent the Beacon; but it was not a bit like it
originally, nor at the present time (for I believe the house is still
standing).&nbsp; Mr. Hinde had not long erected his Tower before he found
that it was giving way.&nbsp; To prevent it falling he ran up a wing to the
westward.&nbsp; He then found that it was necessary to erect a southern
wing to keep that side up also.&nbsp; Hence the present appearance of the
house which has always been a subject of wonder and remark by strangers at
its eccentric and unusual aspect.</p>
<p>I recollect St. Domingo Pit being much more extensive than it has been
of late years.&nbsp; At one period it was fully one-third larger than it is
now.&nbsp; <!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>Those large stones that stand by its brink are the &ldquo;Mere
Stones.&rdquo;&nbsp; There were several more stones about which marked
Everton&rsquo;s ancient boundaries.&nbsp; There was one, I recollect, in
the West Derby-road, near the Zoological Gardens.&nbsp; I often wonder if
this relic of the past has been preserved.&nbsp; A branch of the Pool ran
up the westward and formed an ornamental water in the grounds that skirted
the Pool, a rustic bridge being thrown over it.&nbsp; The cottage at one
corner of the Pool is the ancient pinfold, and the rent of it was paid to
the lord of the manor.&nbsp; The view from this part of Everton was very
fine before houses began to spring up in its vicinity.&nbsp; I do not know
a finer prospect anywhere about Liverpool.&nbsp; When we were staying at
Everton there were very few houses.&nbsp; I dare say there were not fifty
houses in the whole district, and the inhabitants did not muster more than
400 souls; and it was not until 1818 or 1820 that much increase took place
in its population.</p>
<h2><!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p>In 1820, a rather curious circumstance transpired, which created a good
deal of conversation, and even consternation amongst the inhabitants of
Everton.&nbsp; This was the extraordinary and mysterious disappearance of
the Cross which stood at the top of the village, a little to the westward
of where the present Everton road is lineable with Everton-lodge.&nbsp;
This Cross was a round pillar, about four feet from the top of three square
stone steps.&nbsp; On the apex of the column was a sun-dial.&nbsp; This
Cross had long been pronounced a nuisance; and fervent were the wishes for
its removal by those who had to travel that road on a dark night, as
frequent collisions took place from its being so much in the way of the
traffic.&nbsp; When any one, however, spoke of its removal, the old
inhabitants so strongly protested against its being touched, that the
authorities gave up all hope of ever overcoming the prejudice in favour of
its <!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>remaining.&nbsp; However, a serious accident having occurred, it
was at length determined by the late Sir William Shaw, to do what others
dared not.&nbsp; One dark and stormy winter&rsquo;s night, when all Everton
was at rest&mdash;for there were no old watchmen then to wake people up
with their cries&mdash;two persons might have been seen stealing towards
the Cross, in the midst of the elemental war which then raged.&nbsp; One of
them bore a lantern, while the other wheeled before him a barrow, laden
with crowbar, pickaxe, and spade.&nbsp; The rain descended in torrents, and
the night was as dark as the deed they were about to commit could possibly
require.&nbsp; They approached the ancient gathering place, where, in olden
times, during the sweating sickness, the people from Liverpool met the
farmers of the district and there paid for all produce by depositing their
money in bowls of water.&nbsp; Amidst the storm the two men for a moment
surveyed their stony victim, and then commenced its destruction.&nbsp;
First, with a strong effort, they toppled over the upper stone of the
column; then the next, and the next.&nbsp; They then wheeled them away,
stone by stone, to the Round House on Everton-brow, wherein each fragment
was deposited.&nbsp; The base was then ruthlessly removed and carried away,
and at length not a vestige was left to mark the spot where once stood <!--
page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>Everton
Cross&mdash;raised doubtless by pious hands on some remarkable occasion
long forgotten.</p>
<p>The Cross was thus safely housed and stored away in the Round House, and
no one was the wiser.&nbsp; When morning dawned the astonishment of the
early Everton birds was extreme.&nbsp; From house to house&mdash;few in
number, then&mdash;ran the news that Everton Cross had disappeared during
the storm of the previous night.&nbsp; The inhabitants soon mustered on the
spot, and deep and long and loud were the lamentations uttered at its
removal.&nbsp; Who did it?&nbsp; When?&nbsp; How?&nbsp; At length a whisper
was passed from mouth to mouth&mdash;at first faintly and scarcely
intelligible&mdash;until, gathering strength as it travelled, it became at
length boldly asserted that the Father of Lies had taken it away in the
turbulence of the elements.&nbsp; And so the news spread through Liverpool,
in the year 1820, that the Devil had run off with the Cross at
Everton.&nbsp; My old friend, who many a time chuckled over his feat, and
who told me of his doings, said that for many years he feared to tell the
truth about it, so indignant were many of the inhabitants who knew that its
disappearance could not have been attributable to satanic agency.&nbsp; My
friend used to say that he had hard work to preserve his gravity when
listening to the various versions that were prevalent of the
circumstance.</p>
<p><!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>Opposite the Cross there were some very old houses of the same
type, character, and date as that known as Prince Rupert&rsquo;s
cottage.&nbsp; The latter was a low long building, constructed of stone,
lath, and plaster, and presented the appearance of an ordinary country
cottage.&nbsp; Prince Rupert&rsquo;s officers were quartered in the village
houses.&nbsp; At the back of the cottage, Rupert constructed his first
battery.&nbsp; It was a square platform, and was used as a garden, until
cottage and all were swept away for the new streets now to be found
thereabouts.&nbsp; I can recollect the whole of the land from Everton
Village to Brunswick Road being pasture land, and Mr. Plumpton&rsquo;s five
houses in Everton Road, overlooking the fields, commanded high rents when
first erected.&nbsp; Low-hill at this time was a rough, sandy, undulating
lane with hedges on both sides.&nbsp; The only dwellings in it were a large
house near the West Derby-road, and two low cottages opposite
Phythian-street, still standing.&nbsp; The public-house at the corner of
Low-hill and the Prescot-road is of considerable antiquity, there having
been a tavern at this spot from almost all time, so to speak.&nbsp;
Hall-lane was then called Cheetham&rsquo;s-brow.</p>
<p>Amongst other objects of interest that have disappeared at Everton, may
be numbered &ldquo;Gregson&rsquo;s Well,&rdquo; which stood on the left
hand side of the gateway of Mr. Gregson&rsquo;s mansion.&nbsp; This <!--
page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>well,
before water was brought into our town in such abundance, was a great
resort for the matrons, maids, and children of the neighbourhood, and
slaked the thirst of many a weary traveller.&nbsp; It was a fine spring of
water, and was approached by stone steps: the water issuing from a recess
in the wall.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gregson&rsquo;s Well&rdquo; was a known
trysting-place.&nbsp; There was an iron railing which enclosed the side and
ends of the well, to prevent accidents.&nbsp; The water from the well is
still flowing, I have been told.&nbsp; The stream runs underground, behind
the houses in Brunswick-road&mdash;or, at least, it did so a few years
ago.&nbsp; I have seen the bed of the stream that ran in the olden time
down Moss-street, laid open many times when the road has been taken
up.&nbsp; There was a curious story once current about the way that
Brunswick-road obtained its name.&nbsp; It is said that when the new
streets in that vicinity were being laid out and named, the original
appellation which it bore, was chalked up as copy for the painter; but a
patriotic lady, during the absence of the workman rubbed out the old name
and substituted for it &ldquo;Brunswick-road,&rdquo; which name it has ever
since borne.</p>
<p>Where Mr. Gregson&rsquo;s house stood, or nearly so, there was a house
which, in the early part of the last century, belonged to a gentleman and
his sister named Fabius.&nbsp; Their real name was <!-- page 154--><a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>Bean; but, after the
manner of the then learned, they assumed the name of Fabius, from
&ldquo;Faba.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. or, as he was called, &ldquo;Dr.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Fabius was an apothecary, and received brevet rank&mdash;I suppose from
being the only medical practitioner about.&nbsp; At any rate, from the
limited population of the vicinity, he was doubtless sufficient for its
wants.&nbsp; This Mr. Fabius was one of the first Baptists in this part of
the country, and in 1700 obtained a license from Manchester, to use a room
in his house as a prayer-room for that particular class of
worshippers.&nbsp; Mr. Fabius and his sister Hanna built, after a short
time, a chapel or tabernacle of wood, in their garden, and gave to the
Baptists &ldquo;for ever&rdquo; the &ldquo;piece of land adjoining the
chapel-field,&rdquo; as a burying-place; and in this little cemetery have
all the earliest leading members of this influential body been
interred.&nbsp; It has been quite full for some years, and in consequence
the Necropolis Cemetery sprung as it were from it, where dissenters of all
denominations could be buried.&nbsp; The Baptists, increasing in numbers,
quitted Low-hill, and built a chapel in Byrom-street, which is now St.
Matthew&rsquo;s church.&nbsp; When this chapel was built it was thought to
be too far out of town to be well attended.</p>
<p>There once lived a curious person at Low-hill who had peculiar
tastes.&nbsp; He built a place which was called &ldquo;Rat&rsquo;s
Castle.&rdquo;&nbsp; It stood on the brink <!-- page 155--><a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>of a delf, the site
of which is now occupied by the Prescot-street Bridewell.&nbsp; This person
used to try experiments with food, such as cooking spiders, blackbeetles,
rats, cats, mice, and other things not in common use; and, it is said, was
wont to play off tricks upon unsuspecting strangers by placing banquets
before them that were quite unexpected and unprecedented in the nature and
condition of the food.</p>
<p>While lingering over my &ldquo;Recollections&rdquo; of Everton, I ought
not to forget mentioning that, as time went on and Liverpool became
prosperous, and its merchants desired to get away from the dull town-houses
and imbibe healthy, fresh air, this same Everton became quite the
fashionable suburb and court-end of Liverpool.&nbsp; Noble mansions sprung
up, surrounded by well-kept gardens.&nbsp; Gradually the gorse-bush and the
heather disappeared, and the best sites on the hill became occupied.&nbsp;
The Everton gentry for their wealth and their pride were called
&ldquo;Nobles,&rdquo; and highly and proudly did they hold up their heads,
and great state did many of the merchants who dwelt there keep up.&nbsp;
The first mansion erected was on the Pilgrim Estate; the next was St.
Domingo House.&nbsp; A brief history of these estates may not be
uninteresting.&nbsp; In 1790 the whole of Everton hereabouts was owned by
two proprietors.&nbsp; When Everton was all open, waste, and uncultivated
<!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>land, one portion of it was enclosed by a shoemaker who called
his acquisition &ldquo;Cobbler&rsquo;s Close.&rdquo;&nbsp; This property
was bought by Mr. Barton, who realized upwards of &pound;190,000 through
the capture of a French vessel called <i>La Liberte</i>, by a vessel owned
by Joseph Birch, Esq., M.P., called <i>The Pilgrim</i>.&nbsp; The estate of
Cobblers&rsquo; Close was then re-named &ldquo;Pilgrim.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
property next passed into the hands of Sir William Barton, who sold it to
Mr. Atherton.&nbsp; It was this gentleman who gave the land on which
Everton Church is built, with this stipulation only&mdash;that no funerals
should enter by the West Gate.&nbsp; The reason assigned for this was
because Mr. Atherton&rsquo;s house was opposite to it.</p>
<p>Mr. Woodhouse purchased the Pilgrim estate from Mr. Atherton, and
re-named it &ldquo;Bront&eacute;,&rdquo;, from his connection with the
Bront&eacute; estate in Sicily, which had been bestowed on Lord Nelson for
his great services.&nbsp; When Lord Nelson received his first consignment
of Marsala wines ordered for the fleet from his estate, he was asked to
give the wine a name so that it might be known to the English people.&nbsp;
Nelson said &ldquo;call it Bront&eacute;.&rdquo;&nbsp; His lordship was
told that &ldquo;Bront&eacute;&rdquo; meant &ldquo;thunder.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied the hero, &ldquo;it will do very well; John Bull
will not know what it means, and will think all the better of it on that
account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The St. Domingo Estate, in this vicinity, was <!-- page 157--><a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>originated by Mr.
Campbell, who in 1757 purchased the estate.&nbsp; He continually added to
it, as occasion presented, and called the whole &ldquo;St. Domingo,&rdquo;
in consequence of a rich prize taken by a privateer which he owned when off
that island.&nbsp; These two contiguous estates may be said, therefore, to
have been purchased by English bravery.</p>
<p>Mr. Crosbie was the next proprietor.&nbsp; He purchased it for
&pound;3500, paying &pound;680 as deposit money.&nbsp; On his becoming
bankrupt the estate was again put up for sale.&nbsp; It remained some time
on hand, until Messrs. Gregson, Bridge and Parke purchased it for
&pound;4129.&nbsp; They sold it for &pound;3470, losing thereby.&nbsp; In
1793, Mr. Sparling, who was Mayor of Liverpool in 1790, bought it.&nbsp; He
took down the house built by Mr. Campbell and erected the handsome mansion
now standing.&nbsp; This gentleman stipulated in his will that the house
should be only occupied by a person of the name of Sparling, and that it
was not to be let to any person for longer than seven years.&nbsp; In 1810
the legatees got the will reversed by an act of Parliament.&nbsp; The
Queen&rsquo;s Dock was projected by Mr. Sparling, and Sparling-Street was
called after him.&nbsp; The St. Domingo Estate was next sold for
&pound;20,295.&nbsp; It was afterwards resold for &pound;26,383, and used
as barracks.</p>
<p>The objections made by the people of Everton to barracks being formed in
their neighbourhood were very great.&nbsp; A strong memorial was <!-- page
158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>numerously
signed by the inhabitants against the movement.&nbsp; The memorialists
represented the demoralization attendant upon the introduction of numbers
of soldiers into a respectable and quiet neighbourhood, and the annoyances
that would have to be endured.&nbsp; But the prayer failed, and St. Domingo
House, for a time, became barracks accordingly.&nbsp; Everton appears
always to have been a favourite locality for the quartering of soldiery,
when it has been necessary or expedient to station them in the vicinity of
Liverpool.&nbsp; On several occasions entire regiments have been quartered
at Everton.</p>
<p>The encampment of soldiers in the fields near Church-street, which a few
years ago attracted great attention and curiosity, is of too recent
occurrence to require remark from me, as also the occupancy of the large
houses on Everton-terrace and in Waterhouse-lane and Rupert-lane by
officers and men.&nbsp; As of old, the inhabitants of the present day sent
up a remonstrance to the authorities at the Horse Guards, against soldiers
being located in the neighbourhood, but with the same want of
success.&nbsp; A most intolerable nuisance, amongst others, entailed upon
the inhabitants was the beating of what, in military parlance, is called
&ldquo;the Daddy Mammy.&rdquo;&nbsp; This dreadful infliction upon light
sleepers and invalids consisted of half a dozen boys at military daybreak
(that is, as soon <!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>as you can see a white horse a mile off)
learning to beat the drum.&nbsp; The little wretches used to batter away in
Mr. Waterhouse&rsquo;s garden and Rupert-lane half the day through, until
several letters appeared in the newspapers on the subject, which excited
the wrath of the commanding officer of the regiment then stationed there,
who vowed vengeance on all civilians daring to interfere with, or comment
on, the rules of the service.</p>
<p>The Breck-road, and indeed all the roads about Everton were, but a few
years back, mere country lanes, along which little passed except the
farmers.&nbsp; There was no traffic on them as there was no leading
thoroughfare to any place in the neighbourhood of the least
importance.&nbsp; It is only within the last ten years that Everton can be
said to have been at all populous.&nbsp; It was in my young days out by
Breck-road and Anfield (originally called Hangfield), Whitefield-lane, and
Roundhill-lane, completely open country.&nbsp; On Breck-road or Lane the
only house was that at the corner of Breckfield-road, called the &ldquo;Odd
House.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was then a farm.</p>
<p>Connected with Whitefield-lane I recollect a good story told by a
gentleman I knew, of his getting a free ride to Liverpool, behind the
carriage of a well-known eccentric and most benevolent gentleman, some
thirty years ago.&nbsp; My young friend who was then but lately come to
Liverpool, had been <!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>invited to spend Sunday at Whitefield House,
which stands at the corner of Whitefield-lane and Boundary-lane.&nbsp; At
that time there was not a house near it for some distance.&nbsp;
Boundary-lane was a narrow, rutted road, with a hedge and a ditch on each
side, while the footpath&mdash;on one side only&mdash;was in a most
miserable condition.&nbsp; There was then adjoining West Derby-road a large
strawberry garden, which in summer time was the resort of pleasure-seekers,
and it was the only approach to neighbourship along the whole length of the
lane.</p>
<p>On leaving Whitefield House the night proved so intensely dark that my
young friend found himself quite bewildered, and scarcely know whether to
turn to the right or the left, being unacquainted with the locality.&nbsp;
Fortunately turning to the right, he stumbled along the miserable road, and
with the utmost difficulty made his way onward, but not without misgivings
of being knocked down and robbed, as there had been several daring attacks
made upon people at night in that vicinity.&nbsp; He fervently wished
himself in Liverpool, but shortly arriving at the West Derby-road he began
to understand his &ldquo;whereabouts.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having proceeded a few
yards, a carriage passed him driven by a postilion.&nbsp; There was an
unoccupied dicky behind, which my young friend thought it seemed a pity not
to appropriate.&nbsp; Quick <!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>as youth and activity prompted, he climbed
upon the carriage with the notion of the Dutchman &ldquo;that it was better
to ride than walk,&rdquo; and found his condition materially benefited by
being carried through the darkness of the night instead of walking.&nbsp;
When the carriage reached the London-road my friend thought it was time to
alight, as he was then near home; but to his dismay he found that, although
it was very easy to get up, it was not very easy to get down in
safety.&nbsp; On he went with the carriage until it arrived at Lime-street,
and began to turn down Roe-street, which was a good mile from my
friend&rsquo;s lodgings.&nbsp; What was to be done?&nbsp; A bold thought
struck him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hallo, hallo!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll get down
here!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; Upon this the postilion pulled up short, when
down came the window of the carriage, and an inquiry from it took place as
to the reason of the stoppage.&nbsp; My friend had by this time managed to
drop off his perch, when he found the head protruding was that of the
excellent lessee of the Theatre Royal, Mr. Lewis.&nbsp; As he was quite as
polite a man as the worthy lessee himself, on finding to whom he had been
indebted for his ride, he made a very low bow, with thanks for his most
welcome &ldquo;lift,&rdquo; exclaiming with Buckingham, &ldquo;I will
remember that your Grace is bountiful.&rdquo;&nbsp; In very sharp tones
&ldquo;John&rdquo; was told to drive on, while my friend walked away,
quietly laughing in his sleeve at the <!-- page 162--><a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>success of his
impudence, but regretting that he had not alighted sooner to be nearer
home.</p>
<p>Surprising are the changes that have taken place on the West Derby-road
of late years.&nbsp; It was originally called Rake-lane, and Rocky-lane
from Richmond-hill.&nbsp; A complete little town has sprung up upon its
pleasant meadows and bountiful cornfields.&nbsp; The Zoological Gardens,
within a very few years, was the uttermost verge of this suburb.&nbsp; I
recollect very well the opening of those once beautiful gardens.&nbsp; They
were projected by the late Mr. Atkins, a gentleman who was the proprietor
of the largest travelling-menagerie in the country.&nbsp; The place he had
selected for his undertaking was called &ldquo;Plumpton&rsquo;s
Hollow.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was originally a large excavation, whence
brick-clay which abounds in the neighbourhood had been obtained.&nbsp; Mr.
Atkins, possessing great taste and judgment, was highly favoured and much
thought of by the late Lord Derby, who consulted him on many occasions and
honoured him with his patronage, benefiting the gardens as much as he
could, by adding to the collection.&nbsp; Mr. Atkins chose this site for
his gardens, believing it to be far enough out of town for the convenience
of the public, and healthy enough for the due growth of his trees and
plants, and the well-being of his animals.&nbsp; The Zoological Gardens
were, under Mr. Atkin&rsquo;s management, very different, by <!-- page
163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>all
accounts, from what they are now.&nbsp; I have seen on fine summer days,
numbers of ladies of the highest respectability taking the air in them,
accompanied by their children, while at night the attendance was most
excellent, being patronized by the highest families in the town who seemed
to enjoy the amusements provided with the utmost zest and relish.&nbsp; The
collection of animals was remarkable at that time.&nbsp; Captains of
vessels frequently brought rare and curious animals as presents, so that
every week some new specimen of interest was added.&nbsp; I look back with
pleasure to the many hours I have spent in the Gardens shortly after their
being opened.&nbsp; They were admirably conducted, and in great repute as a
zoological collection.&nbsp; Mr. Atkins took his idea of forming them from
the success of the Gardens then lately established in Regent&rsquo;s Park,
and at Kennington, in Surrey.</p>
<p>A great sensation was once produced by the abduction of a Miss Turner
from Miss Daulby&rsquo;s School, on the West Derby-road, by Mr. E. Gibbon
Wakefield.&nbsp; This is the white house that stands retired a field
distant from the road, on the right hand side, about a quarter of a mile
beyond the Zoological Gardens.</p>
<p>The abduction took place in March, 1826.&nbsp; It caused immense
excitement throughout England.&nbsp; Miss Turner was the daughter of Mr.
Turner, of <!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>Shrigley Park, Cheshire.&nbsp; By means of a forged letter
addressed to Miss Daulby, intimating that Miss Turner&rsquo;s mother was
dangerously ill, the young lady was permitted to leave the school for the
purpose of going home.&nbsp; In the carriage in waiting was Mr. E. Gibbon
Wakefield, a widower with one child (a perfect stranger to Miss
Turner).&nbsp; It is believed he had been put up to this disgraceful act of
villainy by a Miss Davies, with whom he was acquainted in Paris, and who
was a member of a small coterie of friends, meeting for social purposes at
each other&rsquo;s houses.&nbsp; This Miss Davies afterwards became the
wife of Mr. E. G. Wakefield&rsquo;s father.&nbsp; She was tried with her
two stepsons for the conspiracy.&nbsp; The object in taking Miss Turner
away was the large fortune in expectancy from her father as his sole child
and heiress.&nbsp; Miss Turner was taken from Liverpool to Manchester, next
to Kendal, and on to Carlisle, and thence across the borders and there
married to Mr. Wakefield; he having represented to her that by marrying
him, he could save her father from impending ruin.&nbsp; From Scotland,
they went to London, thence to Calais, where Miss Turner was found by her
relatives and taken away.</p>
<p>The Wakefields were tried at Lancaster.&nbsp; Edward was found guilty of
abduction and sentenced to transportation.&nbsp; He went to Australia in
<!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>pursuance of his sentence, and after some years became the
Government commissioner.&nbsp; The marriage with Miss Turner was not
consummated.&nbsp; Miss Turner stated that she had received the utmost
politeness and attention from Mr. Wakefield, and had been treated by him
with deference and respect throughout.&nbsp; Had it not been for Mr.
Wakefield&rsquo;s forbearance, it was thought that his sentence would have
been different.&nbsp; Edward Gibbon Wakefield was said to have been a
natural son of Lord Sandwich.&nbsp; He wrote some exceedingly clever works
upon colonial matters, and on emigration.</p>
<h2><!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p>In the fields at the top of Brownlow-hill lane, just where Clarence and
Russell-streets now meet, there was once a Powder House, to which vessels
used to send their gunpowder while in port.&nbsp; This Powder House, in the
middle of the last century, was a source of anxiety to the inhabitants of
the town, who fully anticipated, at any moment, a blow-up, and the
destruction of the town.&nbsp; The Powder House was afterwards converted
into a receptacle for French prisoners.&nbsp; My grandfather knew the place
well.</p>
<p>It does not require a man to be very old to remember the pleasant
appearance of Moss Lake Fields, with the Moss Lake Brook, or Gutter, as it
was called, flowing in their midst.&nbsp; The fields extended from
Myrtle-street to Paddington, and from the top of Mount Pleasant or
Martindale&rsquo;s-hill, to the rise at Edge-hill.&nbsp; The brook ran <!--
page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>parallel with the present Grove-street, rising somewhere about
Myrtle-street.&nbsp; In olden times, before coal was in general use, Moss
Lake Fields were used as a &ldquo;Turbary,&rdquo; a word derived from the
French word <i>Tourbiere</i>, a turf field.&nbsp; (From the way that the
turf is dried we have our term <i>topsy turvy</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, top side
turf way).&nbsp; Sir Edward More, in his celebrated rental, gives advice to
his son to look after &ldquo;his turbary.&rdquo;&nbsp; The privilege of
turbary, or &ldquo;getting turf,&rdquo; was a valuable one, and was
conferred frequently on the burgesses of towns paying scot and lot.&nbsp; I
believe turf, fit for burning, has been obtained from Moss Lake Fields even
recently.&nbsp; Just where Oxford-street is now intersected by
Grove-street, the brook opened out into a large pond, which was divided
into two by a bridge and road communicating between the meadows on each
side.&nbsp; The bridge was of stone of about four feet span, and rose above
the meadow level.&nbsp; The sides of the approach were protected by wooden
railings, and a low parapet went across the bridge. <a
name="citation167"></a><a href="#footnote167"
class="citation">[167]</a>&nbsp; Over the stone bridge the road was carried
when connection was opened to Edge-hill from Mount Pleasant, and
Oxford-street was laid out.&nbsp; When the road was planned both sides of
it <!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>were open fields and pastures.&nbsp; The first Botanic Gardens
were laid out in this vicinity; they extended to Myrtle-street, the
entrance Lodge stood nearly on the site of the Deaf and Dumb Asylum.&nbsp;
In winter the Moss Lake Brook usually overflowed and caused a complete
inundation.&nbsp; On this being frozen over fine skating was enjoyed for a
considerable space.&nbsp; The corporation boundary line was at this side of
the brook.&nbsp; In summer the volunteers sometimes held reviews upon these
fields, when all the beauty and fashion of the town turned out to witness
the sight.&nbsp; At this time all the land at the top of Edge-hill was an
open space called the Greenfields, on part of which Edge-hill church is
built.&nbsp; Mason-street was merely an occupation lane.&nbsp; The view
from the rising ground, at the top of Edge-hill, was very fine, overlooking
the town and having the river and the Cheshire shore in the
background.&nbsp; Just where Wavertree-lane, as it was called, commences
there was once a large reservoir, which extended for some distance towards
the Moss Lake Fields, Brownlow-hill Lane being carried over it.</p>
<p>While we are wandering in this neighbourhood there must not be forgotten
a word or two about Mr. Joseph Williamson (who died about 1841) and his
excavations at Edge-hill.&nbsp; As I believe there is no authentic record
of him, or of them, so far as I can recollect, a brief description of him
and <!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>his strange works may not be uninteresting to the old, who have
heard both spoken of, and to the present generation who know nothing of
their extent and his singularity.&nbsp; It certainly does appear
remarkable, but it is a fact, that many people possess a natural taste for
prosecuting underground works.&nbsp; There is so much of mystery, awe, and
romance in anything subterranean, that we feel a singular pleasure in
instituting and making discoveries in it, and it is not less strange than
true that those who once begin making excavations seem loth to leave
off.&nbsp; Mr. Williamson appears to have been a true Troglodite, one who
preferred the Cimmerian darkness of his vaulted world, to the broad
cheerful light of day.&nbsp; He spent the principal part of his time in his
vaults and excavations, and literally lived in a cellar, for his sitting
room was little else, being a long vault with a window at one end, and his
bedroom was a cave hollowed out at the back of it.&nbsp; In his cellar it
was that he dispensed his hospitalities, in no sparing manner, having
usually casks of port and sherry on tap, and also a cask of London
porter.&nbsp; Glasses were out of use with him.&nbsp; In mugs and jugs were
the generous fluids drawn and drank.&nbsp; When Williamson made a man
welcome that welcome was sincere.&nbsp; Before I say anything about the
excavations, a few &ldquo;Recollections&rdquo; of Joseph himself are worthy
to be recorded.&nbsp; He was born <!-- page 170--><a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>on the 10th of March,
1769, at Warrington, and commenced his career in Liverpool, with Mr. Tate
the tobacco merchant, in Wolstenholme-square.&nbsp; Williamson used to tell
his own tale by stating that &ldquo;I came to Liverpool a poor lad to make
my fortune.&nbsp; My mother was a decent woman, but my father was the
greatest rip that ever walked on two feet.&nbsp; The poor woman took care
that all my clothes were in good order, and she would not let me come to
Liverpool unless I lodged with my employer.&nbsp; I got on in the world
little by little, until I became a man of substance, and I married Betty
Tate, my master&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; When the wedding day arrived I told
her I would meet her at the (St. Thomas&rsquo;) church, which I did, and
after it was all over I mounted the horse which was waiting for me, and
told Betty to go home and that I would come to her after the Hunt.&nbsp; I
was a member of the then famous &lsquo;Liverpool Hunt,&rsquo; and when I
got to the Meet somebody said, &lsquo;Why, Williamson, how smart you
are!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Smart,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;aye!&mdash;a man
should look smart on his wedding day!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Wedding
day,&rsquo; exclaimed some of the fellows, &lsquo;Who have you
married?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t married anybody,&rsquo; I
said, &lsquo;but the parson has married me to old Tate&rsquo;s
daughter!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, where&rsquo;s your wife?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;She&rsquo;s at home, to be sure, where all good wives ought to
be&mdash;getting ready her husband&rsquo;s dinner.&rsquo;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
tell you what, Betty <!-- page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>and I lived but a cat and dog life of it, but
I was sorry to part with the old girl when she did go.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the
day of Mrs. Williamson&rsquo;s funeral, the men employed on the works were
seen lounging about doing nothing.&nbsp; Williamson noticed this, and
inquired the reason?&nbsp; They told him that it was out of respect for
their mistress.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! stuff,&rdquo; said Williamson, &ldquo;you
work for the living, not for the dead.&nbsp; If you chaps don&rsquo;t turn
to directly, I shall stop a day&rsquo;s wages on Saturday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Williamson&rsquo;s appearance was remarkable.&nbsp; His hat was what
might have been truly called &ldquo;a shocking bad one.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
generally wore an old and very much patched brown coat, corduroy breeches,
and thick, slovenly shoes; but his underclothing was always of the finest
description, and faultless in cleanliness and colour.&nbsp; His manners
were ordinarily rough and uncouth, speaking gruffly, bawling loudly, and
even rudely when he did not take to any one.&nbsp; Yet, strange to say, at
a private dinner or evening party, Mr. Williamson exhibited a gentleness of
manner, when he chose, which made him a welcome guest.&nbsp; His fine,
well-shaped, muscular figure fully six feet high, his handsome head and
face made him, when well-dressed, present a really distinguished
appearance.&nbsp; He seemed to be possessed of two opposite
natures&mdash;the rough and the smooth.&nbsp; It was said that once, on a
Royal Duke visiting Liverpool, he received a salute from <!-- page 172--><a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>Williamson, and was
so struck with its gracefulness that he inquired who he was, and remarked
that &ldquo;it was the most courtly bow he had seen out of St.
James&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; Williamson was very fond of children.&nbsp; The
voice of a little one could at any time soothe him when irritable.&nbsp; He
used to say of them, &ldquo;Ah, there&rsquo;s no deceit in children.&nbsp;
If I had had some, I should not have been the <i>arch</i>-rogue I
am.&rdquo;.&nbsp; The industrious poor of Edge-hill found in Williamson a
ready friend in time of need, and when work was slack many a man has come
to the pay-place on Saturday, who had done nothing all the week but dig a
hole and fill it up again.&nbsp; Once, on being remonstrated with by a man
he had thus employed, on the uselessness of the work, Williamson said,
&ldquo;You do as you are told&mdash;you honestly earn the money by the
sweat of your brow, and the mistress can go to market on Saturday
night&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want you to think.&rdquo;&nbsp; He often regaled
his work-people with a barrel of ale or porter, saying they &ldquo;worked
all the better for their throats being wetted.&rdquo;&nbsp; His vast
excavations when they were in their prime, so to speak, must have been
proof of the great numbers of men he employed.&nbsp; He always said that he
never made a penny by the sale of the stone.&nbsp; He gave sufficient, I
believe, to build St. Jude&rsquo;s Church.&nbsp; He used vast quantities on
his own strange structures.</p>
<p>A lady of my acquaintance once caught <!-- page 173--><a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>Williamson intently
reading a book.&nbsp; She inquired its purport.&nbsp; He evaded the
question, but being pressed, told her it was the Bible, and expressed a
wish that he had read much more of it, and studied it, and that he always
found something new in it every time he opened it.&nbsp; This lady said
that the touching way, the graceful expression of Mr. Williamson&rsquo;s
manner, when he said this, took her completely by surprise, having been
only accustomed to his roughness and ruggedness.&nbsp; He added, &ldquo;The
Bible tells me what a rascal I am.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Stephenson, the great
engineer, inspected the excavations, and it was with pride Mr. Williamson
repeated Mr. Stephenson&rsquo;s expressions of high estimation of his
works.&nbsp; Mr. Stephenson said they were the most astonishing works he
had ever seen in their way.&nbsp; When the tunnel to Lime-street from
Edge-hill was in progress, one day, the excavators were astonished to find
the earth giving way under them, and to see men actually under the tunnel
they were then forming.&nbsp; On encountering Mr. Williamson, he told them
&ldquo;he could show them how to tunnel if they wanted to learn a lesson in
that branch of art.&rdquo;&nbsp; It seemed a strange anomaly, and quite
unaccountable that Mr. Williamson should be so chary in allowing any
strangers to visit his excavations.&nbsp; He seemed to keep them for his
own gratification, and it was with the greatest difficulty permission could
be obtained to <!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>go through them.&nbsp; He would say to the
numberless persons who applied, &ldquo;they were not show-shops, nor he a
showman.&rdquo;&nbsp; When he did grant permission he always gave the
obliged parties fully and unmistakably to understand that he was conferring
upon them a great favour.&nbsp; His temper was suspicious.&nbsp; I
recollect being told of a person calling on him, to pay a long over-due
rent account for another person, when, as Williamson was handing over the
receipt, and about to take up the money, he suddenly fixed his keen eye
upon his visitor, and asked him what trick he was going to play him, as it
seemed strange that he should pay money for another man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take
your money away, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and come again to-morrow;
there is something underhand in your proceedings, and I&rsquo;ll not be
done.&rdquo;&nbsp; For some of his tenants he used to execute cheerfully
the most costly alterations, while for others he would not expend a
shilling, and would let his premises go to rack, rather than put in a nail
for them.</p>
<p>There was a house of his once standing at the corner of Bolton-street,
which he built entirely for a whim.&nbsp; It was a great square house, with
enormously wide and long windows.&nbsp; It was of three stories, two upper
tiers and a basement.&nbsp; There was no kitchen to it, no conveniences of
any kind sufficient to render it habitable.&nbsp; From the cellar there was
a tunnel which ran under <!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>Mason-street to the vaults opposite.&nbsp; He
built it intending it for his friend, Mr. C. H---, the artist, who had one
day complained of the bad light he had to paint in, and Mr. Williamson told
him he would remedy that evil if he would wait a bit.&nbsp; Presently he
commenced the house in Bolton-street, and when it was completed the artist
was sent for, and told that it had been built for him as a studio.&nbsp;
Mr. H--- stood aghast on seeing the immense windows, and could not make Mr.
Williamson understand that an artist&rsquo;s light was not wanted in
quantity but quality.&nbsp; Williamson swore lustily at H---&rsquo;s
obstinacy, and could not be made to understand what was really
required.&nbsp; A reverend gentleman, still living and highly respected,
who happened to be passing along the street, was called in to give his
opinion on the subject by Mr. W.&nbsp; He, however, joined issue with Mr.
H---, but neither could make Mr. W. understand the matter.&nbsp; The rooms
were very lofty and spacious, and if I recollect rightly each floor
consisted of only one room.&nbsp; I believe it was never occupied.&nbsp; In
High-street, Edge-hill, Mr. Williamson also built some houses which were
skirted by Back Mason-street.&nbsp; The houses at the corner of High-street
and Back Mason-street were built up from a quarry.&nbsp; They are as deep
in cellarage as they are high, while the rooms in them are
innumerable.&nbsp; Williamson used to call himself &ldquo;King of
Edge-hill,&rdquo; and had great <!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>influence over the work people residing in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; I knew a lady who once had an encounter with
Williamson wherein she came off victorious, and carried successfully her
point.&nbsp; The affair is curious.&nbsp; This lady, about 1838 or
&rsquo;39, wanted a house, and was recommended to go up to Edge-hill and
endeavour to meet with Mr. Williamson and try to get on the right side of
him, which was considered a difficult thing to do.&nbsp; She was told that
he had always some large houses to let, and if she pleased him he would be
a good landlord.&nbsp; Mrs. C---, accompanied by a lady, went up to
Edge-hill and looked about as they were told to do for a handsome-looking
man in a shabby suit of clothes.&nbsp; They were told that they were sure
to find Mr. W. where men were working, as he always had some in his employ
in one way or another in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; On arriving at
Mason-street, sure enough, they espied the object of their search watching
the operations of some bricklayers busily engaged in erecting the very
house in Bolton-street just spoken of.&nbsp; Mrs. C---, who was a sharp,
shrewd person, good looking and pleasant in her manners, sauntered up to
Williamson and inquired of him if he knew of any houses to be let at
Edge-hill.&nbsp; &ldquo;Houses!&rdquo; replied Williamson in his roughest
and rudest style: &ldquo;What should I know of houses, a poor working man
like me!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;I <!-- page
177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>thought you
might have known of some to let, and you need not be so saucy and
ill-tempered.&rdquo;&nbsp; Williamson roughly rejoined, and the lady
replied, and thus they got to a complete wordy contest attracting the
attention of the bystanders, who were highly amused to find that Williamson
had met his match.&nbsp; The lady&rsquo;s sarcasms and gibes seemed to make
Williamson doubly crusty.&nbsp; He at length asked the other
lady&mdash;who, by the way, was becoming nervous and half-frightened at
what was going on&mdash;&ldquo;what this woman,&rdquo; pointing to Mrs.
C---, &ldquo;would give for a house if she could meet with one to her
mind.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. C--- told him &pound;30 per annum.&nbsp; Williamson
burst out with an insulting laugh, and called all the men down from the
house they were erecting, and when they had clustered round him he told
them that &ldquo;this woman wanted a house with ten rooms in it for
&pound;30 a year!&nbsp; Did they ever know of such an unreasonable
request?&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course the men agreed with their employer, and
they were all dismissed after being regaled with a mug of porter
each.&nbsp; Mrs. C--- narrowly watched Williamson and saw through him at
once, and was not surprised on being invited to step into a house close by
and see how she liked it.&nbsp; She found fault with some portions of the
house and approved others.&nbsp; Williamson at length, after a short
silence, inquired whether she really did want a house and would <!-- page
178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>live in
Mason-street.&nbsp; Mrs. C--- replied that she did really require one and
liked the street very much.&nbsp; Williamson then asked her if she was in a
hurry.&nbsp; On being told she was not, he bade her return that day
fortnight at the same hour and he would try then to show her a house he
thought would suit her exactly.&nbsp; With this the ladies departed,
Williamson saying:&mdash;&ldquo;There now, you be off; you come when I tell
you; you&rsquo;ll find me a regular old screw; and if you don&rsquo;t pay
your rent the day it is due I shall law you for it, so be off.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mrs. C--- then said, &ldquo;My husband is a cockney, and I will bring him
with me, and we will see if we can&rsquo;t turn the screw the right
way.&rdquo;&nbsp; The ladies had no sooner arrived at the end of
Mason-street, when on turning to take a last look of their singular friend
they saw the men from the house in Bolton-street all following Williamson
into the house they had just left, and as it eventually proved he had set
them there and then to work to make the alterations she had suggested and
desired.</p>
<p>On the termination of the fortnight the ladies called on their
remarkable friend, and found him in waiting at the house with two great
jugs of sherry and some biscuits on a table.&nbsp; He then took them over
the house, and to their surprise found everything in it altered: two rooms
had been opened into one, one room made into two, two <!-- page 179--><a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>had been made into
three, and so on, and he asked Mrs. C--- if she was satisfied and if the
house would suit her?&nbsp; He appeared to have completely gutted the house
and reconstructed it.&nbsp; Putting it down at an unusually low rent for
what had been done, the bargain was struck between the parties, and the
landlord and his tenant were ever after good friends.&nbsp; He told the
lady he liked her for sticking up to him &ldquo;so manfully&rdquo; and
&ldquo;giving him as good as he sent.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Williamson took
great delight in this lady&rsquo;s children and made great pets of
them.&nbsp; On her family increasing the lady and her husband frequently
asked Williamson to build her an extra room for a nursery, reminding him
that as he was always building something, he might as well build them an
extra room as anything else.&nbsp; He, however, declined until one day the
lady sent him a manifesto from the &ldquo;Queen Of Edge-hill,&rdquo; as he
had been accustomed to call her, commanding him to build the room she
wanted.&nbsp; Williamson, thereupon, wrote her a reply in the same strain,
promising to attend to her commands.</p>
<p>A few mornings after his reply had been received the lady was busy in
her bedroom dressing her baby, when she suddenly heard a loud knocking in
the house adjoining, and down fell the wall, and amid the falling of bricks
and the rising of dust Mr. Williamson himself appeared, accompanied by two
joiners, who fitted a door into the opening, <!-- page 180--><a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>while two bricklayers
quickly plastered up the walls.&nbsp; Through the door next stepped the
landlord.&nbsp; &ldquo;There, madam, what do you think of this room for a
nursery,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;it is big enough if you had twenty
children.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Williamson had actually appropriated the
drawing-room in his own house to her use.&nbsp; She thanked him, but said
he might have given her some warning of what he was going to do, instead of
covering her and the baby with dust, but Williamson laughed heartily at his
joke, while the lady was glad to get a noble room added to her house
without extra rent.&nbsp; This lady told me that one night just previous to
this event they had heard a most extraordinary rumbling noise in Mr.
Williamson&rsquo;s house which continued for a long time and it appeared to
proceed from one of the lower rooms.&nbsp; On inquiring next day of Mr.
Williamson what was the cause of the disturbance he took the lady into a
large dining-room, where she found about fifty newly-painted blue barrows
with red wheels all ranged along the room in rows.&nbsp; These had been
constructed for the use of his labourers and were there stored away until
wanted.</p>
<p>My acquaintance told me that one night they heard in the vaults below
their house the most frightful shrieks and screams, and the strangest of
noises, but they never could ascertain what was the cause of the
commotion.&nbsp; The noises seemed <!-- page 181--><a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>to proceed from
directly below their feet, and yet they fancied they came from some
distance.&nbsp; The cries were not those of a person in agony, but a
strange mixture of most unaccountable sounds.</p>
<p>A good story is told of a quaint speech made to Williamson by the Rev.
Dr. Raffles.&nbsp; The Doctor and the Rev. Mr. Hull, who were neighbours,
and, I fancy, tenants of Williamson&rsquo;s, were once met by him walking
together, when W. exclaimed &ldquo;I say, if I&rsquo;d my way you two
should be made bishops.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Raffles very quickly replied,
&ldquo;Ah, Williamson, you ought to be an <i>arch</i>bishop!&rdquo;
alluding to his well-known predilection for vault building.&nbsp; He once
invited a party of gentlemen to dine with him.&nbsp; The guests were shown
into a bare room with a deal table on trestles in the middle, with common
forms on each side.&nbsp; Williamson, with the utmost gravity, bade his
friends take their seats, placing himself at the head of the table.&nbsp;
Facing each of the guests was a plate of porridge and some hard biscuits of
which they were invited to partake.&nbsp; Some of the party taking this as
an insulting joke, rose and left the room.&nbsp; Williamson, with the
utmost grace, bowed them out without explanation.&nbsp; When the seceders
had retired, a pair of folding doors were thrown open, exhibiting a large
room with a costly feast prepared, to which the remainder of the party
adjourned, laughing heartily over the trick that had <!-- page 182--><a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>been played and the
agreeable surprise in store for them.&nbsp; Another good story is told of
Mr. Williamson.&nbsp; He possessed some property at Carlisle which gave him
a vote at the elections.&nbsp; Sir James Graham&rsquo;s committee sent him
a circular, as from Sir James, soliciting his vote and interest.&nbsp; On
receipt of this letter Williamson flew into a violent passion, went down to
Dale-street there and then, took a place in the North Mail, proceeded to
Carlisle, obtained one of Sir James Graham&rsquo;s placards from the walls,
and posted back to Liverpool without delay.&nbsp; On his arrival at home he
enclosed the obnoxious circular and placard in a parcel which he addressed
with a most abusive letter to Sir James Graham, in which he charged him
with such a string of political crimes as must have astonished the knight
of Netherby, winding up the abuse by asking how he dared to solicit an
honest man for his vote and by what right he had taken so unwarrantable a
liberty.</p>

183</span>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<p>In the last chapter of my &ldquo;Recollections&rdquo; I spoke of the
man&mdash;Joseph Williamson; the present will be of his
&ldquo;excavations.&rdquo;&nbsp; In various parts of the world we find, on
and under the surface, divers works of human hands that excite the wonder
of the ignorant, the notice of the intelligent, and the speculation of the
learned.&nbsp; Things are presented to our view, in a variety of forms,
which must have been the result of great labour and cost, and which appear
utterly useless and inapplicable to any ostensibly known purpose.&nbsp;
Respecting many of these mysterious records of a past age, page after page
has been written to prove, and even disprove, the supposed intent of their
constructors; and it cannot but be admitted that after perusing many an
erudite disquisition, we are sometimes as well-informed, and as near
arriving at a conclusion as to the original purpose for <!-- page 184--><a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>which the object
under discussion was intended, as when our attention was first engaged in
it.&nbsp; In some instances, those who have discovered uses for the strange
remnants of, to us, a dark age, have exceeded in ingenuity the projectors
of those relics.</p>
<p>Could we draw aside the thick veil that hides the future from us, we
might perhaps behold our great seaport swelling into a metropolis, in size
and importance, its suburbs creeping out to an undreamt-of distance from
its centre; or we might, reversing the picture, behold Liverpool by some
unthought-of calamity&mdash;some fatal, unforeseen mischance, some
concatenation of calamities&mdash;dwindled down to its former
insignificance: its docks shipless, its warehouses in ruins, its streets
moss-grown, and in its decay like some bye-gone cities of the east, that
once sent out their vessels laden with &ldquo;cloth of blue, and red
barbaric gold.&rdquo;&nbsp; Under which of these two fates will Liverpool
find its lot some centuries hence?&mdash;which of these two pictures will
it then present?&nbsp; Be it one or the other, the strange undertakings of
Joseph Williamson will perhaps, some centuries from now, be brought again
to light, and excite as much marvel and inquiry as any mysterious building
of old, the purpose of which we do not understand, and the use of which we
cannot now account for.&nbsp; They will be seemingly as meaningless as any
lonely <!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>cairn, isolated broken piece of wall, or solitary fragment of a
building, of which no principal part remains, and which puzzles us to
account for at the present time.</p>
<p>Mr. Williamson&rsquo;s property at Edge-hill, was principally held under
the Waste Lands Commission.&nbsp; His leases expired in 1858.&nbsp; It
commenced adjoining Miss Mason&rsquo;s house, near Paddington, and extended
to Grinfield-street.&nbsp; It was bounded on the west by Smithdown-lane,
along which ran a massive stone wall of singular appearance, more like that
of a fortress than a mere enclosure.&nbsp; Within this area were some of
the most extraordinary works, involving as great an outlay of money as may
be found anywhere upon the face of the earth, considering the space of
ground they occupy.&nbsp; In their newly-wrought state, about the years
1835 and &rsquo;36, or thereabouts, they created intense wonder in the
minds of the very few who were permitted to examine them.&nbsp; During the
last few years, I believe they have been gradually filled up and very much
altered, but they are still there to be laid open some day.&nbsp; Few of us
know much of them, though so few years have elapsed since they were
projected and carried out, since the sounds of the blast, the pick, and the
shovel were last heard in their vicinity.&nbsp; Now what will be said of
these minings, subterranean galleries, vaults and arches, should they
suddenly be discovered a century <!-- page 186--><a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>hence, when their
originator as well as their origin shall have faded away into nothing like
the vanishing point of the painter?&nbsp; Here we behold an astonishing
instance of the application of vast labour without use, immense expense
incurred without hope of return, and, if we except the asserted reason of
the late projector that these works were carried on for the sole purpose of
employing men in times of great need and depression, we have here
stupendous works without perceptible motive, reason, or form.&nbsp; Like
the catacombs at Paris, Williamson&rsquo;s vaults might have been made
receptacles for the dried bones of legions of our forefathers.&nbsp; Again,
they might have been converted into fitting places for the hiding of stolen
goods, or where the illicit distiller might carry on his trade with
impunity.</p>
<p>I hardly know in what tense to speak of those excavations, not being
aware in what state they are at present.&nbsp; A strange place it is, or
was.&nbsp; Vaulted passages cut out of the solid rock; arches thrown up by
craftmen&rsquo;s hands, beautiful in proportion and elegant in form, but
supporting nothing.&nbsp; Tunnels formed here&mdash;deep pits there.&nbsp;
Yawning gulfs, where the fetid, stagnant waters threw up their baneful
odours.&nbsp; Here the work is finished off, as if the mason had laboured
with consummate skill to complete his work, so that all the world might see
and admire, although no <!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>human eyes, save those of the master&rsquo;s,
would ever be set upon it.&nbsp; Here lies the ponderous stone as it fell
after the upheaving blast had dislodged it from its bed; and there, vaulted
over, is a gulf that makes the brain dizzy, and strikes us with terror as
we look down into it.&nbsp; Now we see an arch, fit to bridge a mountain
torrent; and in another step or two we meet another, only fit to span a
simple brook.&nbsp; Tiers of passages are met with, as dangerous to enter
as they are strange to look at.&nbsp; It must ever be a matter of regret
that after Mr. Williamson&rsquo;s death, some one able to make an accurate
survey of the property did not go through and describe it, because it has
been greatly changed since then by the accumulations of rubbish that have
been brought to every part of it.&nbsp; All the most elaborate portions of
the excavations have been entirely closed up.&nbsp; In one section of the
ground (that near Grinfield-street), where there was of late years a
joiner&rsquo;s shop, the ground was completely undermined in galleries and
passages, one over the other, constituting a subterranean labyrinth of the
most intricate design.&nbsp; Near here also was a deep gulf, in the wall
sides of which were two houses completely excavated out of the solid rock,
each having four rooms of tolerable dimensions.</p>
<p>This chasm is now quite filled up.&nbsp; The terrace extending from
Grinfield-street to Miss Mason&rsquo;s <!-- page 188--><a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>house is threaded
with passages, vaults, and excavations.&nbsp; At the northern corner there
is a tunnel eight feet high, and as many wide, which runs up from what was
once an orchard and garden, to a house in Mason-street.&nbsp; The tunnel
is, I should think, 60 yards long.&nbsp; As the ground rises up the hill,
there are several flights of stone steps with level resting-places.&nbsp;
About two-thirds up, where the first flight is encountered, may be seen a
portion of a large vault which runs a short way southwardly.&nbsp; A small
portion of the top of the arch, between it and the steps, is left open, but
for what reason I never could make out.&nbsp; The further end of this vault
opens into another great vault, which I shall presently describe.&nbsp; The
passage is very dry, but the air has a cold &ldquo;gravey&rdquo; taint,
very unpleasant to inhale.&nbsp; At the second landing there is a sort of
recess, into which rubbish from the garden above is shot down through a
spout or funnel.&nbsp; At the top of the passage is a doorway opening upon
the back of a house in Mason-street.&nbsp; This passage or tunnel was
evidently intended for a mode of communication between the house and the
orchard.&nbsp; In the garden or orchard, and near the tunnel mouth, were
four lofty recesses, like alcoves, three of which were four feet
deep.&nbsp; In one of those recesses, which was carried much further back
than the others, the stones were lying as they fell, and there was a
channel on one side <!-- page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 189</span>of the flooring which seemed to have been
intended for a drain.&nbsp; Through a large folding gate access is obtained
from Smithdown-lane into a wide passage or vault, in shape like a
seaman&rsquo;s speaking trumpet.&nbsp; It is broad enough to accommodate
two carts at least, and has been used when the stone has been carted away
from the delph at its eastern end.&nbsp; This vault is constructed of
brick.&nbsp; It gradually deepens at the eastern end, and is about 15 feet
wide, and 20 high.&nbsp; At the opening it is not more than 15 high.&nbsp;
The top outside is covered by soil, and forms part of the garden previously
mentioned.&nbsp; At the left hand side of the tunnel end will be found a
vault, running northward for about fifty or sixty feet.&nbsp; The end of
this vault is the limit of Mr. Williamson&rsquo;s property.&nbsp; The
tunnel already described as running up to Mason-street crosses the top of
this vault.&nbsp; This vault is about thirty-six feet wide and perhaps
thirty feet high, but the floor has been considerably raised since Mr.
Williamson&rsquo;s time by debris and rubbish of all sorts thrown into
it.&nbsp; In the right hand corner of the vault, about ten feet from the
ground, there is the mouth of a tunnel which runs up first towards
Mason-street, it then turns and winds in a variety of ways in passages
continuing under the houses in Mason-street, and opening upon many of the
vaults.&nbsp; To the left of the entrance vault, there is a large square
area from which immense masses <!-- page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>of red sandstone have been quarried.&nbsp; It
is forty feet from side to side.&nbsp; There is a vault in the southern
wall opposite the wall just described.&nbsp; It runs towards
Grinfield-street, and is composed of two large arches side by side,
surmounted by two smaller ones.&nbsp; In the eastern face of the quarry
there is an immense arch perhaps sixty feet high; and about thirty feet
from its entrance there is an immense and massive stone pier from which
spring two arches on each side, one above the other, but not from the same
level.&nbsp; The pier is hollowed on the inside by three arches.&nbsp; On
the left hand wall inside the arch there are two large arches, from which
vaults run northwardly, and on the right hand side of the wall there are
also two vaults which extend to a great distance in a southwardly
direction, towards Grinfield-street.&nbsp; From these vaults, other vaults
branch off in all sorts of directions.&nbsp; The houses in Mason-street all
rest upon these arches; and as you passed along the street, the depth of
some of them at one time was visible through the grids.&nbsp; The
construction of these arches is of the most solid description, and seems
stable as the earth itself.&nbsp; There are some openings of vaults
commenced at the end near Grinfield-Street, but discontinued.&nbsp; These
arches seem to have given way and presented a curiously ruined
aspect.&nbsp; In the lower range of vaults there was a run of water and
what Williamson called &ldquo;a quagmire.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 191--><a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>In several places
there are deep wells, whence the houses in Mason-Street seem to be supplied
with water.&nbsp; Sections of arches commenced, but left unfinished, were
visible at one time in various places.&nbsp; The lowest range of arches
opening from the Grinfield-street end run to the northward.&nbsp; From the
roof of many of these vaults were stalactites, but of no great
length.&nbsp; The terraced gardens are ranged on arches all solidly
built.&nbsp; The houses in Mason-street are strange constructions.&nbsp; In
one house I saw there was no window in one good-sized room, light being
obtained through a funnel carried up to the roof of the house through an
upper floor and room.&nbsp; This strange arrangement arose from Mr.
Williamson having no plan of the house he was building for the men to work
by, consequently it was found the windows had been forgotten.&nbsp; He
never had, I believe, any drawings or plans of either his houses or
excavations.&nbsp; The men were told to work on till he ordered them to
stop.&nbsp; In another house I went through there was an immense room which
appeared as if two stories had been made into one.&nbsp; The
bedroom&mdash;I believe there was only one in the house&mdash;was gained by
an open staircase, run up by the side of the west wall of the large
room.&nbsp; After passing the room door you mounted another flight of
stairs which terminated in a long lobby, which ran over the top of the <!--
page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>adjoining house, to two attics.&nbsp; The gardens of this house
were approached by going down several stone steps (all was solid with Mr.
Williamson) past the kitchen, which was also arched, and thence down
another flight of stone steps until you came to a lofty vaulted passage of
great breadth.&nbsp; You then entered a dry, wide arch.&nbsp; From this
another arch opened in a northwardly direction.&nbsp; At the end of the
principal vault was a long, narrow, vaulted passage, which was lighted by a
long iron grating which proved to be a walk in a garden belonging to two
houses at a distance.&nbsp; This passage then shot off at right angles, and
at length a garden was gained on a terrace, the parapet wall of which
overlooked the large opening or quarry previously described; and a fearful
depth it appeared.</p>
<p>Some of the backs of the Mason-street houses project, some recede, some
have no windows visible, others have windows of such length and breadth as
must have thrown any feeble-minded tax-gatherer when he had to receive
window duty into fits.&nbsp; These houses really appear as if built by
chance, or by a blind man who has felt his way and been satisfied with the
security of his dwelling rather than its appearance.&nbsp; The interiors of
these houses, however, were very commodious, when I saw them years
ago.&nbsp; They were strangely arranged, with very large rooms and <!--
page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>very
small ones, and long passages oddly running about.</p>
<p>I recollect once going over a house in High-street which Williamson
erected.&nbsp; The coal vault I went into would have held at least two
hundred tons of coals.&nbsp; In all these vaults and places the rats
swarmed in droves, and of a most remarkable size.&nbsp; I once saw one
perfectly white.&nbsp; Wherever Williamson possessed property there did his
&ldquo;vaulting ambition&rdquo; exhibit itself.</p>
<p>Such is a brief account of Williamson and his works.&nbsp; A book might
be filled with his sayings and doings.&nbsp; Amid all his roughness he was
a kind and considerate man, and did a great deal of good in his own strange
way.&nbsp; His effects were sold by Trotter and Hodgkins on the 7th June,
1841, and one of the lots, No. 142, consisted of a view of
Williamson&rsquo;s vaults and a small landscape.&nbsp; I wonder what has
become of the former.&nbsp; Lot 171 was a &ldquo;cavern scene&rdquo; which
showed the bent of the man&rsquo;s taste.</p>

<p>The conversion of the huge stone quarry at the Mount into a cemetery was
a very good idea.&nbsp; This immense excavation was becoming a matter of
anxiety with the authorities, as to what should be done with so large an
area of so peculiar a nature.&nbsp; To fill it up with rubbish seemed an
impossibility; while the constant and increasing demand for stone added to
the difficulties of the situation.&nbsp; The establishment of a cemetery at
Kensal Green in Middlesex, suggested the conversion of this quarry to a
similar purpose.&nbsp; A feeling in the minds of people that the dead
should not be interred amidst the living, began to prevail&mdash;a feeling
that has since grown so strong as to be fully recognised in the extensive
cemeteries now formed at the outskirts of this and all large towns.&nbsp;
Duke-street used to be called &ldquo;The road to the <!-- page 195--><a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>Quarry,&rdquo; and
was almost solely used by the carts bringing stone into the town.&nbsp;
Eighty years ago, there were only a few houses at the top of this street,
having gardens at the back.&nbsp; There was a ropery which extended from
the corner of the present Berry-street (called after Captain Berry, who
built the first house in it), to the roperies which occupied the site of
the present Arcades.&nbsp; All above this was fields, with a few houses
only in Wood-street, Fleet-street, Wolstenholme-square, and
Hanover-street.&nbsp; This latter street contained some very handsome
mansions, having large gardens connected with them.</p>
<p>Rodney-street was laid out by a German named Schlink, who, being
desirous to perpetuate his name, called his new thoroughfare
Schlink-street.&nbsp; Several houses were erected in it, but the idea of
living in &ldquo;Schlink&rdquo;-street&mdash;the word &ldquo;Schlink&rdquo;
being associated with bad meat&mdash;deterred persons from furthering the
German&rsquo;s speculation.&nbsp; In deference to this notion, the name of
the then popular hero, &ldquo;Rodney,&rdquo; was given to the street; and
it has continued to be occupied by families of the highest respectability,
and especially of late years by the medical profession.</p>
<p>I recollect a rather curious circumstance, connected with one of the
best houses in this street, which caused some amusement at the time amongst
those who were acquainted with the particulars <!-- page 196--><a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>and the
parties.&nbsp; It was a complete instance of &ldquo;turning the
tables.&rdquo;&nbsp; About thirty years, or more, ago, a gentleman lived in
Rodney-street, whose commercial relations required him to be frequently in
the metropolis.&nbsp; He found his presence there was likely to be
continuous, and determined to give up his house in Liverpool and reside
permanently in London.&nbsp; He, therefore, took steps to let his house
(which he held under lease at one hundred and five pounds per annum) by
advertising it, and putting a bill in the window to that effect.&nbsp; To
his surprise he received a notice from his landlord informing him that by
the tenure of his lease, to which he was referred, he would find that he
could not sub-let.&nbsp; Finding this to be the case, he went to the owner
of the property, and expressed a desire to be released from his occupancy
on fair terms, offering to find a substantial tenant and pay half a
year&rsquo;s rent.&nbsp; The landlord, knowing he had a good tenant,
rejected this offer in a way somewhat approaching to rudeness.&nbsp;
Finding himself tied to the stake, as it were, the gentleman inquired under
what terms he could be released?&nbsp; The answer was, that nothing short
of twelve months rent and a tenant, would suffice to obtain a
release.&nbsp; Without making a reply to this proposal, the gentleman went
his way.&nbsp; A few mornings after this interview, the owner of the house,
in passing, saw a man painting the <!-- page 197--><a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>chequers <a
name="citation197"></a><a href="#footnote197" class="citation">[197]</a> on
the door cheeks, and on looking up found that &ldquo;--- --- was licensed
to sell beer by retail, to be drunk on the premises.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Astonished at this proceeding, he ordered the painter to stop his work, but
the painter told him he was paid for the job, and do it he would.&nbsp; On
being told who it was that spoke to him his reply was that he did not care,
and that he might go to a place &ldquo;where beer is not sold by retail nor
on the premises,&rdquo; for aught he cared.&nbsp; Furious at this
insolence, the angry landlord sent word to his tenant that he wanted to see
him, at the same time giving him notice of what he would do if he persisted
in appropriating the house to the <!-- page 198--><a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>purpose
intimated.&nbsp; The only answer returned was, that the tenant would be at
&ldquo;the beer-shop&rdquo; at ten in the morning, where he would meet his
landlord.&nbsp; At ten, accordingly, the old gentleman went to his tenant,
and on meeting him asked him what was the meaning of his proceedings.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied the tenant, &ldquo;I find by my lease that it is
true I cannot sub-let, and as you will not accept what I consider fair
terms of release, I intend, for the remainder of my term, to keep the place
open as a beer-shop.&nbsp; I have taken out a license, bought furniture for
the purpose, and here comes the first load of forms and tables&rdquo; (at
that moment, sure enough, up came a cart heavily laden with all sorts of
beer-house requisites).&nbsp; &ldquo;I intend to make the drawing-room a
dancing saloon, and the garden a skittle alley.&nbsp; I have engaged an old
warehouseman to manage the business for me, and if we don&rsquo;t do a
roaring business, I hope to make enough to pay your rent, and become free
from loss.&rdquo;&nbsp; The intense anger of the landlord may be imagined;
and he left the house uttering threats of the utmost vengeance of the law;
but on an interview with his attorney he found there was no redress&mdash;a
beer-shop was &ldquo;not in the bond.&rdquo;&nbsp; He, therefore, went
again to his refractory tenant, for it was clear that if the house was once
opened as a beer-shop, the adjoining property would be deteriorated.&nbsp;
He was smilingly greeted, and his <!-- page 199--><a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>tenant regretted that
he had not tapped his ale, or he would have offered him a glass.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come, Mr. ---,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;let us see if we
cannot arrange this matter.&nbsp; I am now willing to accept your offer of
half a year&rsquo;s rent, and a tenant.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said
Mr. ---, &ldquo;I cannot think of such terms now.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
then, suppose you give me a quarter&rsquo;s rent, and find me the
tenant.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then the rent without
the tenant.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then a tenant
without the rent.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No; but I will tell you what
I&rsquo;ll agree to, my good sir&mdash;you see, I have been put to some
expense.&nbsp; I made you a fair, and, as I think, a liberal offer, which
you would not accept.&nbsp; Now, if you will reimburse me all the expense I
have been put to, and pay &pound;10 to the town charities, I will abandon
my beer-house scheme, undertake to give up the key, and close the account
between us.&rdquo;&nbsp; With these terms the landlord eventually complied,
thus having &ldquo;the tables fairly turned&rdquo; upon him.</p>
<p>Cock-fighting was at one time a favourite sport in Liverpool, amongst
the lower orders, and, indeed, amongst all other classes too.&nbsp; In a
street leading out of Pownall-square (so called after Mr. William Pownall,
whose death was accelerated during his mayoralty in 1708, in consequence of
a severe cold, caught in suppressing a serious riot of the Irish which
occurred in the night-time in a place near the Salthouse Dock, called the
Devil&rsquo;s acre), there <!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>was a famous cock-pit.&nbsp; The street is now
called Cockspur-street.&nbsp; Where the cock-pit stood there is a small
dissenting chapel, and the entrance to it may be found up a court.&nbsp;
This cock-pit was the resort of all the low ruffians of the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; In consequence of the disturbances which continually
took place, it was suppressed as the neighbourhood increased in
population.&nbsp; It is rather singular that in more than one instance
cock-pits have been converted into places of public worship.&nbsp; The
cock-pit at Aintree, for instance, was so converted; and the first sermon
preached in it was by the Rev. Dr. Hume, who skilfully alluded to the
scenes that had been enacted in it, without in the least offensively
describing them.&nbsp; That sermon was a remarkable one, and made a great
impression on the congregation assembled there for the first time.&nbsp;
The late Lord Derby was an enthusiastic cock-fighter, and kept a complete
set of trainers and attendants.&nbsp; When I was a boy, it was thought
nothing of to attend a cock-fight, and, such was the passion for this cruel
sport, that many lads used to keep cocks for the purpose.</p>
<p>It is a curious thing to watch the changes that have taken place from
time to time in different neighbourhoods as to the character of the
inhabitants.&nbsp; Where at one time we may have found the aristocracy of
the town assembling, we have noticed its respectability gradually fading
away, and <!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>those who inhabited large mansions removing elsewhere.&nbsp; For
instance, Rose-hill, Cazneau-street (called after Mr. Cazneau; at one time
a pretty street indeed, with gardens in front of all the houses), and
Beau-street, were fashionable suburban localities.&nbsp; St. Anne-street
abounded in handsome mansions and was considered the court-end of the
town.&nbsp; The courtly tide then set southward; Abercromby-square, and its
neighbourhood sprung up, and so surged outward to Aigburth one way and to
West Derby another.&nbsp; Everton I have already spoken of.&nbsp; I
remember the houses in Faulkner-terrace remaining for years unfinished, and
it was at one time called &ldquo;Faulkner&rsquo;s Folly,&rdquo; from the
notion that no one would ever think of living so far out of the town.&nbsp;
Mr. Faulkner, however, proved himself to be more long-sighted than those
who ridiculed his undertaking.</p>
<p>I remember the present Haymarket a field with a rivulet flowing through
the midst of it, and the whole of this neighbourhood fields and
gardens.&nbsp; In Cazneau-street there was an archery lodge, a portion of
which is still standing.</p>
<p>I remember, too, the erection of Richmond Fair, in 1787.&nbsp; It was
projected by a Mr. Dobb, who dwelt in a bay-windowed house still standing
in St. Anne-street.&nbsp; He intended it for a Cloth Hall for the Irish
factors to sell their linens in, which they brought in great quantities at
that time to <!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>Liverpool.&nbsp; The Linen Hall at Chester gave him the idea of
this undertaking.&nbsp; It took very well at first, but in consequence of
complaints being made by the shopkeepers in the town that the dealers in
linen, instead of selling wholesale were carrying on an extensive retail
trade and injuring their business, the authorities stopped all further
traffic in it, and, after remaining some years unoccupied, it has of late
been converted into small tenements.</p>
<h2><!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<p>Thirty years ago Great Charlotte-street, at the Ranelagh-street end, was
a narrow, poorly-built thoroughfare.&nbsp; On the left hand side, looking
south, between Elliot-street and the present coach-builders&rsquo;
establishment, there was a timber-yard, in which stood a small wooden
theatre, known as &ldquo;Holloway&rsquo;s <i>Sans Pareil</i>,&rdquo; and
truly it was <i>Sans Pareil</i>, for surely there was nothing like it,
either in this town or anywhere else.&nbsp; Both inside and outside it was
dirty and dingy.&nbsp; There were only a pit and gallery, the latter taking
the place of boxes in other theatres; and, yet the scenery was excellent,
the actors, many of them, very clever, and the getting up of the pieces as
good as could be in so small a place.&nbsp; The pantomimes at Christmas
were capital.&nbsp; The charges of admission were: to the pit 3d., and to
the gallery, 6d.&nbsp; The audiences, whether men or women, boys or girls,
were the <!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>roughest of the rough.&nbsp; The quantity of copper coin taken at
the doors was prodigious; and I am told that it occupied two persons
several hours, daily, to put the money up into the usual five-shilling
packages.&nbsp; Mr. Holloway used to stand at one door and his wife at the
other, to receive the admission money.&nbsp; When the audience was
assembled, the former would go into the pit and there pack the people, so
that no space should be lost.&nbsp; He would stuff a boy into one, or a
little girl into another seat, and leave them to settle down into their
proper places; giving one a buffet and another a knock on the head, just to
encourage the others to keep order and be obedient to his will and
wish.&nbsp; There was no space lost in the pit of Holloway&rsquo;s theatre,
whatever there might be anywhere else.&nbsp; A thriving business was
carried on in this little bit of a theatre, and if the highest class of
performances was not produced, nothing at any time offensive to order and
morality was permitted.</p>
<p>I remember a good joke in which a gentlemen whom I knew, connected with
one of our newspapers, and a leading actress at the Theatre Royal, were
concerned, in connection with a visit to the <i>Sans Pareil</i>.&nbsp; The
lady was very desirous to see a piece which was got up with great
<i>eclat</i> at the <i>Sans Pareil</i>, and which was attracting crowds of
people to see it.&nbsp; I think it was entitled &ldquo;Maria <!-- page
205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>Martin; or,
the Murder at the Red Barn.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having expressed her wish to my
friend, he at once offered to escort her any evening on which she was
disengaged.&nbsp; Fixing, therefore a night when her services in
Williamson-square were not required, my friend and the fair
<i>comedienne</i> betook themselves to Great Charlotte-street and presented
themselves at the gallery door where the gentleman tendered the price of
their admission.&nbsp; Now the lady had a thick veil on that she might, as
she hoped, conceal her well-known features.&nbsp; But it seems that Mr.
Holloway had at once recognised his fair visitor.&nbsp; On the money being
tendered to Mrs. Holloway at the gallery door, Mr. H. called out from his
door, &ldquo;Pass &rsquo;em in&mdash;all right, missus.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now my
friend was well aware that Mr. Holloway knew him, and therefore supposed
that as a press man he would not allow him to pay&mdash;not supposing for a
minute that the muffled up figure of his companion had been recognised.</p>
<p>So in they went and managed to climb up the half ladder, half stair,
that led to the &ldquo;aristocratic&rdquo; region of the auditory part of
the theatre.&nbsp; These stairs were frightfully dirty and steep.&nbsp; A
broom had not been near them for months, and the lady, picking up her ample
skirts, endeavoured to avoid all contact with both stairs and walls.&nbsp;
On emerging from the top landing into the theatre, they found the place in
a state of semi-darkness.&nbsp; <!-- page 206--><a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>They could just make out a few rows of
benches, and clustering in the middle front were about thirty people.&nbsp;
The noise was horrible, and seemed more so through the prevailing
darkness.&nbsp; Shoutings, bawlings, whistlings, and screamings were in
full swing, and the lady paused for a moment, whispering to her companion,
&ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s go back&mdash;I can&rsquo;t stand this at any
price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My friend, however, urged his companion to remain, and at length they
managed to scramble forward, and secure a front seat at one side.&nbsp; The
clamour was now added to by the entrance of the band, who mingled the
sounds of tuning instruments with the other discords prevalent.&nbsp; Just
at this juncture in came Mr. Holloway, who commenced the packing process,
much to the amusement of our lady friend, who now began, in spite of the
heat, the offensive smells, and the row, to become curious, and determined
to see all that was to be seen.&nbsp; Presently the lights were fully
turned on, and the orchestra struck up a lively medley tune, suitable to
the taste of the audience.&nbsp; The orchestra, though small, was a good
one, and some very clever performers were amongst its members.&nbsp; The
play at length commenced, and appeared to create great interest and command
attention.&nbsp; The lady admitted that the characters were well
represented, and the drama very creditably got up.&nbsp; At length came a
very sensational portion of the play.&nbsp; <!-- page 207--><a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>That part where
<i>Maria Martin</i> is enticed into the Red Barn by <i>Corder</i>.&nbsp; In
this exciting scene, <i>Maria</i>, as if having a presentiment of her fate,
stands still and refuses to move.&nbsp; She appears in a state of stupor
and <i>Corder</i> endeavours to urge her to accompany him.&nbsp; Now there
were seated in the middle of the pit two sweeps, who appeared deeply
interested in the performance, and finding that <i>Corder</i> could not
induce <i>Maria</i> to go forward, one of them, amidst the silence that the
cunning of the scene had commanded, screamed out&mdash;&ldquo;Why
don&rsquo;t you give her some snuff, and make her sneeze!&rdquo;&nbsp; The
silence thus broken was broken indeed, and the house roared with
laughter.&nbsp; Our two friends were not backward in partaking of the
merriment.&nbsp; The lady went almost into hysterics, so violent were her
paroxysms of mirth.&nbsp; In the midst of the clamour, Holloway, hearing
these loud bursts of laughter at a time when there should be complete
silence, rushed on to the stage, fancying something had gone wrong.&nbsp;
Darting to the footlights, as well as his little fat figure would let him,
he roared out, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this here row about?&rdquo; and
glancing round to see on whom he could heap his vengeance, he caught sight
of our two friends, and looking up indignantly at them, he
continued&mdash;&ldquo;I von&rsquo;t have no row in my the-a-ter.&nbsp; If
you vants to kick up a row you&rsquo;d better go the The-a-ter
R&rsquo;yal.&rdquo;&nbsp; The <!-- page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>audience seeing Mr. Holloway addressing the
gallery, all eyes were now turned up to where our friends were seated, and
the lady, (who had thrown up her veil in consequence of the intense heat)
being recognised, was saluted by some one shouting out &ldquo;Three cheers
for Mrs. ---,&rdquo; whereupon the audience began hurrahing, in the midst
of which our two adventurers made off as quickly as they could.&nbsp; They
declared that neither of them could tell how they did so, being conscious
of nothing until they found themselves breathing the fresh air in
Lime-street.</p>
<p>When Stephen Price, the American manager, was in Liverpool beating up
recruits, in, I think, 1831, Templeton, the tenor singer, was playing at
the Theatre Royal.&nbsp; At that time Madame Malibran had made Templeton
famous, by selecting him to enact the part of <i>Elvino</i> to her
<i>Amina</i>, and thus a very second-rate singer suddenly jumped into the
first place in public opinion, by his association with the gifted woman who
enchanted all her hearers.&nbsp; Templeton waited on Price relative to an
engagement in America, when the following conversation took
place:&mdash;&ldquo;I should like to go to America, Mr. Price, if you and I
could agree about terms.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Very good, Mr.
Templeton.&nbsp; What would you expect, Mr. Templeton?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, I should just expect my passage out and home, and thirty
&lsquo;punds&rsquo; a week, Mr. Price, to begin with.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!--
page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&ldquo;Well&mdash;no&mdash;I&mdash;ah&mdash;no!&mdash;nothing occurs to me
just now, Mr. Price.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Mr. Price,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you d---d first, Mr. Templeton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a very good story current in Liverpool, some twenty-five years
ago, about Mr. W. J. Hammond, a then great favourite, both as actor and
manager, and an acquaintance of mine.&nbsp; About that time a very flashy
gentleman went into the Adelphi Hotel, and after making minute inquiry as
to the bill of fare, and what he could have for dinner, at length ordered
&ldquo;a mutton chop to be ready for him at five
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;&nbsp; Five o&rsquo;clock came, and also the
traveller, who sat down in the coffee room to his banquet.&nbsp; He helped
himself to the water at his own table and then emptied the bottles at the
next, and at length called on the waiter for a further supply.&nbsp; When
the mutton chop was duly finished, the waiter inquired what wine his
&ldquo;lordship&rdquo; would take.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;ah!&mdash;wine!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take&mdash;another bottle
of&mdash;&lsquo;water.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray, sir,&rdquo; said
the waiter (leaning the tips of his thumbs upon <!-- page 210--><a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>the table) with a
most insinuating manner&mdash;&ldquo;Pray, sir, would you like the
<i>Bootle</i> or the <i>Harrington</i> water?&rdquo;&nbsp; Hammond heard
this, and agreed, with the friend referred to, to enter the Hotel, one at
each door, and severally call out, one for a glass of
&ldquo;Harrington,&rdquo; and the other for a glass of &ldquo;Bootle&rdquo;
water.&nbsp; &ldquo;Waiter, some Bootle water!&rdquo; came from a voice at
the Copperas-hill door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Waiter, some Harrington water!&rdquo;
was the order proceeding from the traveller entering by the front
door.&nbsp; These strange orders, breaking upon the stillness that pervades
this well-conducted hotel, seemed to excite great surprise in one or two
aristocratic guests, who were standing in the lobby, when just at the
moment Mr. Radley came out of one of the rooms and recognised the
jokers.&nbsp; Taking them into his sanctum, he provided them with something
stronger than the stream from the good old red sandstone.&nbsp; After a
short time Mr. R. was called out, and the two guests began to get impatient
at his non-return.&nbsp; Hammond declared that he must go&mdash;so did his
friend; but they both thought it would seem unmannerly to leave the hotel
without seeing their entertainer.&nbsp; Which should remain?&nbsp; However,
Hammond soon cut the matter short by bolting out of the room and locking
the door.&nbsp; His friend sat patiently enough for some little time, fully
expecting Mr. Radley&rsquo;s return, but, while waiting, fell <!-- page
211--><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>asleep.&nbsp; When he awoke he found himself in darkness,
wondering where he could possibly be.&nbsp; After groping about some time,
he discovered that the door was locked.&nbsp; The trick Hammond had played
him then flashed across his mind.&nbsp; Hunting about, he at length found
the bell which soon brought some one to the door, and on its being opened a
rather severe questioning took place, as to how the visitor got there and
what was his object.&nbsp; Mr. Radley having in the meantime gone home, he
could not be referred to.&nbsp; It was only after sending for some person
who knew the gentleman that he was released, and certainly not without some
suspicions attaching to his visit and his peculiar position.</p>
<p>I recollect a good anecdote of a favourite actor in Liverpool some
twenty years ago, when he was engaged at the Theatre Royal as one of the
stock company.&nbsp; Mr. S--- was a constant church-goer, as many actors
and actresses are, although those who do not know them fancy they cannot be
either good or religious&mdash;a great mistake.&nbsp; Mr. S--- was
accommodated by a friend, who had a very handsomely fitted up pew in St.
A---&rsquo;s Church, with the use of it, and Mr. S--- occupied it so long
that he quite considered it to be his own; and it was a standing joke
amongst his intimates that on all occasions &ldquo;my pew&rdquo; was
referred to.&nbsp; Being out one night rather late, with some <!-- page
212--><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>&ldquo;jolly
companions,&rdquo; he and they found, on comparing timepieces, that if they
were not quick in getting home unpleasant consequences would ensue amongst
their domestic relations.&nbsp; Said one, &ldquo;I must be
off.&rdquo;&nbsp; Said another, &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t make haste shall be
locked out.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; said S---, &ldquo;never mind
being locked out, I&rsquo;ll go and get the key of St. A---&rsquo;s church,
and you shall <i>sleep in my pew</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>On turning over my &ldquo;Recollections&rdquo; of our theatre, there was
one circumstance connected with the drama in Liverpool that I shall not
forget.&nbsp; It made a great impression on my mind, as it did no doubt
upon all those who, at the time, interested themselves in the success of
the movement.&nbsp; I allude to the brilliant demonstration that took place
in December, 1816, when an amateur performance was got up in aid of the
distress experienced in Liverpool, a distress felt in common with the whole
nation.&nbsp; All the leading theatrical and musical amateurs in the town
took part in that performance.&nbsp; I dare say that, at this distance of
time even, it is well remembered by those who assisted at it, if there be
any of them still amongst as.&nbsp; I am quite certain that the patriotic
feelings which urged them to unite and give their valuable services at so
trying a time must still and ever be <!-- page 214--><a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>a source of
gratification to them of the highest order.</p>
<p>At the date I refer to, great commercial distress prevailed.&nbsp;
Amongst the working and lower classes the most frightful indigence and
destitution were experienced.</p>
<p>After the battle of Waterloo all sorts of property depreciated in
value.&nbsp; Everything previously was at a &ldquo;war price.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The amount of taxation which the country had to endure may be judged when I
state that for a house rented at forty pounds per annum the following were
the taxes levied upon its occupier:&mdash;Window tax, &pound;11 4s. 6d.;
inhabited house duty, &pound;2 18s. 6.; land tax, &pound;1 16s.; highway
and church rates, &pound;2 13s. 9d.; poor rates, &pound;18; making a total
to be paid of &pound;36 12s. 9d.!&nbsp; The failure of the harvest that
year added also to the general distress so that the nation might have been
said to have been on the very eve of bankruptcy.&nbsp; So bad was the flour
in 1816, and so scanty the supply, that everybody seemed occupied in
hunting up and inventing new modes of preparing it for consumption, as well
as appropriating unheard of articles as food.&nbsp; I recollect even
&ldquo;saw-dust&rdquo; was attempted to be converted into bread, while
horse-beans were cooked in all sorts of ways to be made palatable, and were
also ground down to a sort of flour as a substitute for wheat.&nbsp; The
newspapers teemed with cautions <!-- page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>to the public to use the utmost economy, while
recipes without end appeared as to how bad flour could be best used and
made wholesome.&nbsp; It will scarcely be credited that even a public
notice emanated from the Town Hall on this subject, signed by Mr. Statham,
the Town Clerk.&nbsp; I have by me a copy of it, which, as it may interest
some of my readers, I will give entire.&nbsp; It is headed&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">JOHN WRIGHT, MAYOR.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">MAKING OF BREAD.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">NOTICE TO HOUSEKEEPERS,<br />
<span class="smcap">and dealers in flour</span>.</p>
<p>Complaints having been made against some of the Flour Dealers in this
town for having sold Flour unfit for the making of Bread, the Mayor thinks
proper to acquaint the Public that, upon an investigation of such
complaints, it appeared that in many instances blame was not imputable to
the Flour Dealer, but to the Purchaser of the Flour in not having taken
proper precautions in the Making of the Bread, which, owing to the state of
the Flour this season, it was necessary to have taken, and which had been
pointed out to the party by the Flour Dealer.</p>
<p>From the above circumstance, the Mayor has been induced to recommend to
all Dealer&rsquo;s in Flour upon the Sale of any Flour which, although not
unsound, may render proper precautions necessary in the use of the same, to
apprise their several customers thereof; and the Mayor has been further
induced to recommend to all Housekeepers the adoption of the following
system in the Making of Bread:&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>To boil the water and let it stand till of a proper heat, to
knead the Flour well, using as little water as possible, and let it stand a
sufficient time to rise; to use fresh Water Barm, and bake the Bread on the
oven bottom, in small loaves of not more than 2lb. to 3lb. weight; to use,
as much as possible, Cakes or Hard Bread, and not to use the Bread new.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">By Order of the Mayor,<br />
STATHAM, <span class="smcap">Town Clerk</span>.</p>

<p>In London the distress was so great that the people there were full of a
rebellious element; at a meeting in Spitalfields, whereat the celebrated,
or, if the term be more appropriate, &ldquo;notorious,&rdquo; Henry Hunt
was present, and addressed a numerous assembly, frightful disorders took
place.&nbsp; Meetings of large bodies of the people were held in all the
leading cities and towns throughout the kingdom to petition the Prince
Regent and parliament to do something effectual to stay the tide of
calamity that seemed to be setting steadily in to overwhelm the nation.</p>
<p>The petition from Liverpool was most numerously and respectably signed;
and I recollect that so determined were the memorialists to ascertain
whether their petition had been properly presented that a correspondence
took place on the subject and was made public, between his worship the
mayor, Sir W. Barton, and General Gascoigne, one of our members, relative
to its having reached its destination.</p>
<p><!-- page 217--><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>The price of wheat in the month of December, 1816, was 21s. per
70lbs., while the quartern loaf of 4lb. 5oz. cost 1s. 6&frac34;d.&nbsp; The
penny loaf only weighed 3oz. 1&frac14; dr.</p>
<p>To the credit of the working classes in Liverpool, the utmost patience
and forbearance was exhibited under intense sufferings.&nbsp; I recollect
well the energy exhibited by the gentry of the town, in their endeavours to
raise funds for the general relief.&nbsp; The Dock Trustees employed
numbers of people at 2s. a day.&nbsp; A large loan was raised to enable
them to give unlimited employment.&nbsp; The leading firms in the town were
subscribers to this loan, which was headed by the Norwich Union Life and
Fire Office with &pound;1000.&nbsp; In the churches and chapels charity
sermons were constantly preached, and the clergy of all denominations urged
their flocks to give anything at all, and not to withhold even their
mites.</p>
<p>Gentlemen formed themselves into parties to canvass subscriptions for
the poor from house to house, while the ladies left no stone unturned to
further the cause of charity.&nbsp; It was a most remarkable epoch in the
history of this country, and certainly in Liverpool the time was as trying
as could possibly be conceived.&nbsp; Merchants and tradesmen were daily
failing.&nbsp; Great houses, apparently able to stand any amount of
pressure, gave way, and many of the provincial banks succumbed, <!-- page
218--><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>adding to
the horrors of the time.&nbsp; Amongst other schemes afloat to relieve
distress in Liverpool was the benefit got up at the Theatre Royal, to which
I have referred.&nbsp; The prices of admission were doubled on the
occasion.&nbsp; The box tickets were 9s., the upper boxes, 8s., the pit,
6s., and the gallery, 2s.; and the proceeds realised no less a sum than
&pound;610!&nbsp; The performances were the &ldquo;Poor Gentleman,&rdquo;
&ldquo;A Concert,&rdquo; by musical amateurs, and the burlesque of
&ldquo;Bombastes Furioso.&rdquo;&nbsp; The characters were personated for
the most part in each of the pieces by amateurs, amongst whom were several
of the leading gentlemen of the town, who spared no pains, study, nor cost
to render their exertions successful.</p>
<p>There may be still left amongst us some of those who took part in the
glory of that memorable evening of Saturday, December 7, 1816.&nbsp; At
this distant time, they may still indulge in a feeling of pride at their
successful endeavours to further a good cause, and they will not, I am
sure, be offended at an old man recording the amount of talent they
exhibited, nor the zeal they manifested in fully carrying out the plan
proposed for the public amusement and the welfare of the poor.&nbsp; I
recollect there was an admirably written prologue, by Dr. Shepherd, which
was as admirably delivered by Mr. J. H. Parr, in the character of
<i>Stephen Harrowby</i>, <!-- page 219--><a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>a character which he personated in the play
with all the finish of an experienced actor, his exertions drawing forth
frequent and loud applause.&nbsp; <i>Dr. Ollapod</i> was personated by Dr.
Carter, who excited roars of laughter.</p>
<p>I recollect the names of Messrs. Aldridge, Bartleman, Cooper, Greaves,
Halewood, Hime, Jackson (a distinguished violoncello player, by the way),
Langhorne, Maybrick, Tayleure (a distinguished double bass), and
Vaughan.&nbsp; In &ldquo;Bombastes Furioso,&rdquo; <i>King Artaxomines</i>
was personated by Mr. Richmond; <i>Fusbos</i> by Mr. Clay; <i>General
Bombastes</i> by Mr. J. H. Parr, who elicited shouts of laughter by his
drollery and admirable acting.&nbsp; Miss Grant, of the Theatre Royal
Company, played <i>Distaffina</i>.&nbsp; The house was crowded in every
part, the whole town seemed to take an interest in the matter, and every
nerve was strained to command success.&nbsp; In fact so well did those who
had undertaken the disposal of tickets succeed, that numbers of persons
could not gain admission although possessing tickets, while hundreds who in
vain crowded round the doors were unable to obtain entrance &ldquo;for love
or money.&rdquo;&nbsp; A more cordial display of goodwill was never known
in this town, nor was there ever a more enthusiastic, elegant, or better
pleased audience assembled within the walls of the Theatre Royal than on
that occasion.</p>
<p><!-- page 220--><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>At this time there was considerable ferment in the public mind,
relative to, and consequent upon, the escape of Lord Cochrane from the
King&rsquo;s Bench prison, and when the gallant and noble lord was
re-captured and re-committed with a fine of &pound;100 inflicted upon him,
the men of Liverpool were early astir in the noble sailor&rsquo;s
behalf&mdash;a subscription box was opened instantly the matter became
known in Liverpool, and it was resolved that not more than a
&ldquo;penny&rdquo; should be given by each person towards the fine, and
each subscriber should, on payment of his money, sign his name and
address.&nbsp; A shop at the corner of John-street and Dale-street, was one
place appointed for the reception of pence and names, while another was in
Mersey-street opposite the end of Liver-street.&nbsp; Crowds of persons
were assembled round these places who loudly and admiringly canvassed the
noble lord&rsquo;s conduct.&nbsp; He was quite the hero of his day, and in
no place had his lordship more enthusiastic admirers than in Liverpool
amongst the liberal party.&nbsp; By the people generally, he was quite
idolized.&nbsp; In a very short time 2500 pence and names were obtained,
and had 25,000 been wanted, I am sure they would have been as readily
subscribed.&nbsp; As it may be interesting to some of my readers to know
how the &pound;100 fine was paid, I can give them some particulars
thereupon, &pound;85 was paid in bank notes, &pound;5 in silver, and
&pound;10 in <!-- page 221--><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>copper.&nbsp; It was said in a joke, that if the whole amount had
been tendered in brass it would have been readily accepted, so glad were
authorities to get rid of so troublesome a customer.</p>

222</span>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<p>On Sunday morning, February 11, 1810, I was standing in St. Nicholas
churchyard, in company with two old friends.&nbsp; We were waiting the
arrival of the congregation, and the commencement of the morning
service.&nbsp; The second bells were chiming.&nbsp; We had been looking on
the river with that interest which is always felt in gazing upon such a
scene.&nbsp; Our conversation had turned upon the benefits which a good
sound Christian education must confer upon the lower classes of
society.&nbsp; Education at the period to which I refer was then beginning
to take hold of the public mind, as an essential to the well-doing of the
people.&nbsp; This subject in later years, as is known, has become an
absorbing question.&nbsp; Our remarks had been evoked by the neat
appearance of the children of the Moorfields Schools, who had just passed
near where we stood, as they entered the church.&nbsp; One <!-- page
223--><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>of us
remarked in reference to the Tower close by, that it was the dower of the
Lady Blanche, the daughter of John O&rsquo;Gaunt, who, although occupying
so eminently marked a place in history, was a man so narrow-minded that he
would not allow any of his vassals to receive the least education as he
held that it unfitted them for the duties of their station, and gave them
ideas far above their lot in life.&nbsp; A curious speculation was hazarded
by one of my friend&rsquo;s that as Water-street was anciently called
&ldquo;Bank-street,&rdquo; whether the word &ldquo;Bank&rdquo; ought not to
have been &ldquo;Blanche&rdquo;-street; a name given to it in honour of the
lady to whom the principal building in the street belonged, when, just as
he had finished speaking, we heard, as if above us, a smart crack.&nbsp; On
looking round to ascertain the cause, a sight burst upon our view, that
none who witnessed it could ever forget.&nbsp; The instant we turned, we
beheld the church tower give way, on the south-west side, and immediately
afterwards the spire fell with a frightful and appalling crash into the
body of the building.&nbsp; The spire seemed at first to topple over, and
then it dropped perpendicularly like a pack of cards into a solid heap,
burying everything, as may be supposed, below it.&nbsp; There were many
persons in the churchyard, waiting to enter the sacred edifice, and, like
ourselves, were struck dumb with horror and dismay at the frightful <!--
page 224--><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>catastrophe.&nbsp; We were soon aroused to a state of
consciousness, and inaction gave way to exertion.&nbsp; In a very short
time, the noise of the crash had brought hundreds of persons into the
churchyard to ascertain the cause.&nbsp; Amidst the rising dust were heard
the dreadful screams of the poor children who had become involved in the
ruins; and not long after, their screams were added to by the frantic
exclamations of parents and friends who, in an incredibly short time had
hurried to the scene of the disaster.&nbsp; Crowds of people rushed into
the churchyard, some hurrying to and fro, scarcely knowing what to fear or
what to do.&nbsp; That the children were to be exhumed was an immediate
thought, and as immediately carried into execution.&nbsp; Men of all ranks
were seen, quite regardless of their Sunday clothes, busily employed in
removing the ruins&mdash;gentlemen, merchants, tradesmen, shopmen and
apprentices, willingly aiding the sturdy labourers in their good work, and,
in a short time, first one little sufferer, and then another, was dragged
out from the mass of stone and brick and timber that lay in a confused
heap.&nbsp; Twenty-eight little ones were at length brought out, of whom
twenty-three were dead; five were alive, and were taken to the Infirmary,
but of these, only three survived.&nbsp; They were horribly maimed, and so
disfigured that they were scarcely recognizable.&nbsp; These <!-- page
225--><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>twenty-eight
poor little bodies were at first laid in rows in the churchyard to be
claimed by their parents and friends, many of whom were to be seen running
to and fro looking distracted with the great calamity that had befallen
them.&nbsp; Of all the pitiable sights I ever beheld, the sight of these
little things laid on the grass was the most piteous; and, as, one by one
they were claimed and taken away&mdash;in some instances parents claiming
two, and in one instance, three children&mdash;the utmost sympathy was felt
for those who had been so suddenly bereft.</p>
<p>It was most fortunate that the accident did not occur half an
hour&mdash;nay, a quarter of an hour&mdash;later, or the calamity might
have been such as would have marked the day as one of the darkest in our
annals&mdash;a frightful spot in our calendar.&nbsp; Beside the children,
there were only about twenty people seated in the church, far from the
scene of the disaster, and they, on the first indication of danger, had
fled and sought safety outside the building.&nbsp; How the bell-ringers
escaped, it is impossible to tell, but escape they did, and that unhurt,
with the exception of one, who rushed back to get his clothes and was
killed.&nbsp; It was to their intense stupidity and obstinacy that this
catastrophe may be ascribed.&nbsp; Previous to the accident, they had been
told that the tower was unsafe, and on that <!-- page 226--><a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>very morning, they
were advised not to ring the bells again, until an examination of the
building had taken place: but ring they would, and ring they did, and the
result of their ringing was a death-knell unmatched in local history.</p>
<p>Nor were the authorities altogether free from blame.&nbsp; It was said
that they were apprised of the insecurity of the tower, and yet did not
take steps to avoid the accident.&nbsp; The escapes of people on their way
to church were wonderful, and many traced their good fortune to being tardy
in getting ready, or from leaving home at an usually late moment.&nbsp; The
scene of the disaster was for a long time an attraction to people residing
miles from Liverpool, and the country around sent thousands to gaze on the
unusual sight presented to their view.</p>
<p>In the same year the sad calamity I have just recorded took place, the
Theatre Royal was the scene of a frightful disturbance, which ended in the
trial at Lancaster of several highly respectable men, for being partakers
in it.&nbsp; I have a distinct recollection of this affair, and a more
disgraceful one to all parties concerned in it, cannot be imagined.&nbsp;
These riots were termed the H. P. riots.</p>
<p>In the September of the preceding year there had been considerable
agitation in the theatrical world of London, and dreadful riots had taken
<!-- page 227--><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>place as to the old prices, and the question was whether new and
advanced prices should be charged for admission to the theatres.&nbsp; A
number of individuals, as many as forty, were tried for the offence of
rioting at Covent Garden, when, to the surprise of everyone, the whole of
the party were found &ldquo;Not guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no doubt that this strange verdict in reference to most
outrageous and unjustifiable conduct had put it into the heads of many
people in Liverpool that similar conduct might be indulged in, with like
impunity, respecting the Theatre Royal.&nbsp; There had been frequent
attempts made to induce the lessees of the theatre, Messrs. Lewis and
Knight, to permit a half-price to be taken.&nbsp; The plea for the request
was that numbers of persons who would like occasionally to visit a theatre
were debarred doing so from the fact that their hours of employment were so
late that they could not get away in time to attend when the performances
commenced, and they thought it a hard case that they should be obliged to
pay full price for only half the quantity of amusement.&nbsp; The lessees
pleaded their expenses were just the same, whether the people came at full
price or half-price, and since the Theatre Royal had been established no
such arrangement had been attempted, and as it would not pay them to
concede a half price they declined to do so.&nbsp; They <!-- page 228--><a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>said their
undertaking in the theatre was a private speculation for a public purpose,
and they had no right to be compelled to do, what no other tradesmen would
be expected to do, that is, prosecute their business at a loss.&nbsp; The
play-goers, however, seemed determined to carry things with a high hand,
and endeavour to force Messrs. Lewis and Knight to come to their
terms.&nbsp; The season was announced to commence on the 11th of May, 1810,
when there appeared, a few days previously, on the walls of the town the
following placard:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">THE THEATRE OPENS<br />
ON MONDAY NEXT, 11TH MAY.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">THE MANAGERS<br />
Have been requested to permit admission at</p>
<p style="text-align: center">HALF-PRICE,</p>
<p>As in London, etc. (and elsewhere), but they still persist in the
injustice of demanding FULL PRICES, from those who have it not in their
power to attend until a very late hour, when a good and material part of
the performance is over!&nbsp; We have even a greater right to the
indulgence than the London audiences&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">LET US<br />
BOLDLY CLAIM IT<br />
AND<br />
WE MUST SUCCEED!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This placard was followed by others.&nbsp; An abusive letter also made
its appearance, as well as <!-- page 229--><a name="page229"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 229</span>a pamphlet equally offensive, in which the
lessees were held up to scorn, ridicule, and opprobrium.&nbsp; In fact,
every step was taken to excite the (play-going) public mind on the subject
of &ldquo;half-price or full-price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the opening night arrived, crowds of people assembled outside the
theatre, and the rush to get in, when the doors opened, was immense.&nbsp;
Numbers of places had been previously taken in the boxes, by persons who
were seen to be most actively engaged in the riots in the theatre
afterwards.&nbsp; No sooner had the curtain rose to the play of
&ldquo;Pizarro&rdquo; than the row began&mdash;shoutings, bawlings,
whistlings, hornblowings, turnings of rattles, flappings of clappers, and
every noise that could be made by the human voice was indulged in, and the
uproar seemed to increase as the night went on&mdash;such a scene of
confusion can hardly be conceived, and amidst the turbulence that reigned
placards were exhibited demanding &ldquo;half-price.&rdquo;&nbsp; In vain
the managers attempted to obtain a hearing&mdash;in vain favourite actors
came forward, hoping to be heard&mdash;the play proceeded, but all in
&ldquo;inexplicable dumb show and noise.&rdquo;&nbsp; These riots were
repeated on the nights of the 14th and 16th, when it was found necessary to
close the theatre.&nbsp; Each night the same riotous behaviour was
exhibited.&nbsp; In fact, to such an extent had it arrived that the <!--
page 230--><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>Mayor
was at length sent for, and read the Riot Act.&nbsp; The mob outside threw
brick-bats, stones, and all sorts of missiles at the windows, which they
completely smashed, breaking away even the woodwork of the frames.&nbsp;
The people outside kept bawling &ldquo;Half-price!&rdquo; and when any of
the known adherents of the full price attempted to get out of the theatre
they were driven back and insulted, while those in favour of
&ldquo;Half-price&rdquo; were cheered and applauded most
vociferously.&nbsp; At length, it was determined by the magistrates that
the strong arm of the law should be stretched out, and in consequence, six
persons who had been most active in the disturbances were arrested, and
brought to trial at the autumn assizes at Lancaster, for conspiracy and
riot.&nbsp; These delinquents were all gentlemen of position in the town,
and, as may be supposed, the case excited the utmost attention and
interest.&nbsp; The case was tried on the 14th September.&nbsp; Sir Robert
Graham was the judge.&nbsp; I remember Serjeant Cockle was for the
prosecution, assisted by Messrs. Park, Topping, Holroyd, and Clark, nearly
all of whom, by the way, I think, have since obtained seats on the judicial
bench.&nbsp; The council for the defence were Messrs. Raine, Scarlett
(afterwards Sir James Scarlett), Raincock, and Richardson.&nbsp; Sergeant
Cockle, in opening the case highly lauded Messrs. Lewis and <!-- page
231--><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>Banks as
actors, men, and citizens, and pointed out to the jury how monstrous the
conduct of the prisoners had been, in attempting to force an unprofitable
movement upon anyone.&nbsp; I recollect he made use of this remarkable
expression, &ldquo;that every person resorting to a theatre has a right to
express his dissatisfaction against any thing he sees, either of the plays
performed or the actors, and that he must do this honestly: but if he
conspire with others to damn any play or condemn any actor, punishment
should follow such conspiracy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the trial Mr. Statham, the Town Clerk, gave also evidence for the
prosecution.&nbsp; After the court had been occupied some time, and many
witnesses had been examined, an attempt was made on the part of the judge
to effect a compromise, His Lordship remarking that he thought the ends of
justice had been served in the public exposure and annoyance which the
defendants had been put to, and that as the temper of the people had
subsided, and even a better understanding existed between the public and
the lessees than before, he thought it was of no use to carry the case any
further.&nbsp; The council for the prosecution, however, would not consent
to this; at the same time they assured the judge and the court, that the
prosecution was not carried on by the lessees, but by the magistrates of
the <!-- page 232--><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>borough, who were determined to put a stop, by all means in their
power, to a recurrence of such disgraceful proceedings, and attempts on the
part of an unthinking public to force gentlemen to do what they did not
consider right or equitable.&nbsp; The verdict returned was &ldquo;guilty
of riot, but not of conspiracy.&rdquo;</p>

233</span>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<p>I have never been much of a play-goer, but have occasionally visited the
theatres when remarkable performers have appeared.&nbsp; I recollect many
of the leading actors and actresses of the close of the last century, while
all the great ones of this I have seen from time to time.&nbsp; Joe Munden,
Incledon, Braham, Fawcett, Michael Kelly, Mrs. Crouch, Mrs. Siddons, Madame
Catalani Booth, and Cooke, and all the bright stars who have been
ennobled&mdash;Miss Farrell (Lady Derby), Miss Bolton (Lady Thurlow), Miss
Stephens (Countess of Essex), Miss Love (Lady Harboro), Miss Foote
(Marchioness Harrington), Miss Mellon (Duchess of St. Alban&rsquo;s), Miss
O&rsquo;Neil (Lady Beecher)&mdash;but I must say the old and the new style
of acting, appear to be very different.&nbsp; Mrs. Siddons exhibited the
highest perfection <!-- page 234--><a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>of acting.&nbsp; I cannot conceive anything
that can go beyond it in dramatic art.</p>
<p>I was present when John Kemble bade farewell to the Liverpool
audiences.&nbsp; It took place in the summer of 1813.&nbsp; The play was
&ldquo;Coriolanus.&rdquo;&nbsp; The house was crowded to excess, and the
utmost enthusiasm was exhibited in favour of the great tragedian; who,
although not a townsman, was at any rate a county man, he having been born
at Prescot.</p>
<p>Mr. Kemble, when addressing the audience on that occasion, made a very
remarkable declaration.&nbsp; He said that &ldquo;it was on the Liverpool
stage he first adapted the play of &lsquo;Coriolanus,&rsquo; and produced
it, as they had just seen it performed, and that it was the earnest
encouragement he then received that proved a great stimulus to him in after
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A statement of the sums of money received at benefits amongst the
&ldquo;old stagers&rdquo; may perhaps interest some of my readers.&nbsp; I
am going back a long way, but I do so that those who know or who guess at
the receipts of the &ldquo;moderns&rdquo; may compare them with those of
the &ldquo;ancients.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1795 Mrs. Maddocks, a most delightful
actress, and an immense favourite in Liverpool, drew &pound;213; Mrs.
Powell, &pound;207; Mr Banks, &pound;183; Mr. Whitfield, &pound;135.&nbsp;
Mr. Kelly, the Irish singer, and Mrs. Crouch, a most charming and
fascinating <!-- page 235--><a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>woman, with a lovely voice, realised together &pound;136; Mr.
Hollinsworth, &pound;124; and Mr. Ward &pound;119.&nbsp; In modern days the
Clarkes (the manager and his wife) have received as much as &pound;300 at
their benefits.&nbsp; One of the best speculations Mr. Lewis ever made was
the engagement of Paganini, shortly after his first appearance in the
metropolis, in, I think, 1829 or 1830.&nbsp; This wonderful genius had
taken the musical world of London by storm, and struck terror and despair
into the hearts of the violinists of his day; one and all of whom
declaring, as a friend of mine said of his own playing&mdash;although
eminent in his profession&mdash;&ldquo;that they were only
fiddlers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Paganini&rsquo;s playing was most unearthly and
inhuman.&nbsp; I never heard anything like the tones he produced from his
violin&mdash;the sounds now crashing as if a demoniac was tearing and
straining at the strings, now melting away with the softest and tenderest
harmonies.&nbsp; He kept his hearers enthralled by his magical music, and
astonished by his wonderful execution.&nbsp; I shall never forget hearing
him play the &ldquo;Walpurgis Nacht,&rdquo; when he appeared at the
Amphitheatre in 1835 or 1836.&nbsp; It was painting a picture by means of
sounds.&nbsp; His descriptive powers were wonderful.&nbsp; Anybody with the
least touch of imagination could bring before &ldquo;his mind&rsquo;s
eye&rdquo; the infernal revel that the artist was depicting.&nbsp; The
enchantments of the witches were visible.&nbsp; <!-- page 236--><a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>You could hear their
diabolical songs, you could fancy their mad and wild dances; while, when
the cock crew (imitated by the way in a most astonishing manner), you would
feel that there was a rushing of bodies through the air, which were
scattering in all directions.&nbsp; Then the lovely melody
succeeding&mdash;descriptive of the calm dawn of summer morning&mdash;came
soothingly on the senses after the strain of excitement that the mind had
experienced.&nbsp; In that delicious melody you could fancy you saw the
rosy colours of the breaking day and gradually the rising of the sun,
giving light and beauty to the world.&nbsp; That performance was the most
wonderful I ever listened to, and I feel confident no one but those who did
hear this strange man can ever entertain any notion of his style or
performance.&nbsp; His first engagement in Liverpool was at the Theatre
Royal, and a characteristic anecdote is related of the Signor in this
transaction.&nbsp; At the Amphitheatre, Signor De Begnis, the great harp
player&mdash;the husband of the fascinating Ronzi de Begnis, and who ran
away with Lady Bishop, (he was the ugliest man for a Cavaliero I ever saw,
being deeply pitted with the smallpox)&mdash;had been giving some concerts
which were exceedingly unsuccessful.&nbsp; The people engaged got no money,
De. Begnis having completely failed in the speculation.&nbsp; The news of
this having reached London, Paganini heard of it, <!-- page 237--><a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>and when Mr. Lewis
proposed to engage him, he jumped at the conclusion that this was the same
as De Begnis&rsquo;s speculation and that there could be only one theatre
in Liverpool.&nbsp; He accordingly declined to come to Liverpool, unless
the money to be paid to him was first lodged at his bankers (Messrs.
Coutts) in London.&nbsp; Mr. Lewis saw through the Signor&rsquo;s error at
once, and immediately remitted &pound;1000 to ratify the engagement for ten
nights.&nbsp; Paganini played his ten nights and drew on each of them from
&pound;280 to &pound;300, so that, great as the risk was, the speculation
was a most advantageous one to the lessee.&nbsp; When Paganini came to the
Amphitheatre in 1835 or &rsquo;36 (I think) with Watson as his manager, and
Miss Watson as his <i>Cantatrice</i>, he did not draw as on his first
appearance, although the houses were very good.&nbsp; I recollect talking
to Mr. Watson on the stage between the parts, when the gods, growing
impatient, whistled loudly for a re-commencement of the performance.&nbsp;
Paganini, who happened to be near us, seemed rather surprised at the noise,
and turning to Watson he inquired <i>qu&rsquo;est que c&rsquo;est ces
tapageurs ces siffleurs</i>? and on being told, he grinned horribly, and
said in a low voice&mdash;<i>Bah</i>! <i>betes</i>!</p>
<p>I once was told, by one of the actors employed at the Theatre Royal, a
curious anecdote of a remarkable and distinguished lady.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t recollect the year it happened, but I think it <!-- page
238--><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>must have
been about 1829.&nbsp; In that year a carriage drove up to the Theatre
Royal, containing two ladies, attended by a man-servant in green and gold
livery.&nbsp; The servant went into the theatre to inquire if Mr. Clarke,
the stage-manager, was in.&nbsp; On being answered in the affirmative, the
stoutest of the two ladies&mdash;for the other lady was quite
young&mdash;stepped out of the carriage, and without ceremony walked
through the lobby straight upon the stage, to the utter surprise of the
hall-keeper who, like a masonic tyler, allows no one to pass without a word
or sign of recognition that they are of the privileged.&nbsp; The man
followed the lady, who, stepping to the footlights, gazed around on that
most desolate of all desolate, dreary, dingy places, the inside of a
theatre by daylight.&nbsp; On her still handsome countenance alternated
emotions of pride, regretful feeling, as well as of deep interest.&nbsp;
After looking across the pit for a few moments, she turned to the
hall-porter and requested him to announce to Mr. Clarke that a lady wished
to see him for a few minutes.&nbsp; The man quickly returned, requesting
the lady to follow him, but she, passing him, made her way to the treasury
with the air and mien of one who well knew the way to that place of torture
when a &ldquo;ghost does not walk.&rdquo;&nbsp; The lady accosted Mr.
Clarke with a winning air, and seeing that she was not recognised, said,
&ldquo;So you don&rsquo;t recollect me?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, indeed, I
do not.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, <!-- page 239--><a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>that is strange,
considering the money you have paid me.&nbsp; Why,&rdquo; she continued,
&ldquo;do you not recollect who played <i>Little Pickle</i> at Swansea and
Bristol in 18--?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Bless me!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr.
Clarke.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! I see you know me now,&rdquo; said the lady
laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;And many a week&rsquo;s salary I have had
there,&rdquo; continued the buxom visitor, pointing to the pay-place,
&ldquo;and now just let me have something paid to me to remind me of old
times.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon she went to the pay-place, when the gallant
stage-manager put down a week&rsquo;s salary as of old, which the lady took
up, returning it however, and placing at the same time in Mr.
Clarke&rsquo;s hand, a note for &pound;20, which she desired him to
distribute amongst the most needy of the company.&nbsp; The lady was the
Duchess of St. Alban&rsquo;s.&nbsp; When Miss Mellon, she had been engaged
at the Theatre Royal, and the first benefit she had was in Liverpool.&nbsp;
I knew a gentleman who exerted himself greatly on her behalf on that
occasion, and the success of it was mainly attributable to his
efforts.&nbsp; This she always gratefully acknowledged, and I recollect his
telling me that once, being in London, this admirable and kind-hearted
lady&mdash;who so worthily used the wealth at her command, after she was
ennobled&mdash;recognised him while passing down Pall Mall and beckoned him
to the side of her magnificent equipage, and there recalled the old time to
his recollection acknowledging the old obligation, assuring him <!-- page
240--><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>that if she
could in any way serve him she would be delighted to do so.</p>
<p>The Theatre Royal, about forty odd years ago was under the lesseeship of
Messrs. Lewis and Banks.&nbsp; Mr. Banks was extremely fond of a good and
well-dressed dish; he had a person as cook who had been with him some
years, and who suited his taste in his most choice dishes.&nbsp; The two
had a serious quarrel, which ended in cooky giving her master notice of
leaving his service.&nbsp; Mr. Banks took this somewhat to heart as he
thought if he parted with his cook&mdash;and such a cook as she
was&mdash;he might not be able to replace her.&nbsp; To put it out of her
power to give him notice again, he offered her marriage, and was
accepted.&nbsp; Mrs. Banks sometimes used to visit the theatre, and
generally took her seat at the wing by the prompter&rsquo;s table, where
she could see tolerably well what was going forward on the stage.&nbsp; On
one occasion the tragedy of &ldquo;Venice Preserved&rdquo; was being
performed.&nbsp; Edmund Kean was <i>Jaffier</i> and Miss O&rsquo;Neil
<i>Belvidera</i>.&nbsp; They were playing to a greatly excited house, as
may well be supposed when two such artists were upon the stage.&nbsp; Mr.
St. A---, who was then ballet-master at the theatre, and who, by the way,
was a most graceful dancer, seeing Mrs. Banks, went up to her to exchange
compliments.&nbsp; Having done so, Mr. St. A--- remarked how <!-- page
241--><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>seldom they
had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Banks.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied she,
&ldquo;I never come to the theatre&mdash;not I.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no good
actors now-a-days&mdash;there ain&rsquo;t anybody worth
seeing.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear me, Mrs, B., how can you say so?&nbsp; Who
have we on the stage now?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Mr.
Kean&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Kean, indeed,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. B.,
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t abide him; he&rsquo;s my abortion.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, then, what do you think of Miss O&rsquo;Neil?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Miss O&rsquo;Neil!&mdash;Miss O&rsquo;Neil, indeed; do you call her
a hactress?&mdash;I can&rsquo;t abide her.&nbsp; There she is&mdash;see how
she lolls and lollups on the fellows&mdash;it&rsquo;s quite
disgusting!&rdquo;&nbsp; Now the fact was that Miss O&rsquo;Neil who was
chastity itself off the stage, and who lead a most blameless life, showed,
when performing, such <i>abandon</i> and <i>impressment</i> in her actions
as to be quite remarkable, especially in parts where the intensity of
passion had to be displayed, and this Mrs. Banks &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t
abide.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; continued Mr. St. A---,
&ldquo;who do you call a good actor?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who do I call a
good actor! you wait till my dear John Emery comes down, and then
you&rsquo;ll see a good actor; and if I live as long, I&rsquo;ll make him
such a pudding, please God, as he hasn&rsquo;t had this many a
day!&rdquo;&nbsp; Old Mrs. Banks was about right as to John Emery; he was
an actor of the first-class, and has never been replaced in his peculiar
line.&nbsp; I have seen Emery play <i>Tyke</i> in the <!-- page 242--><a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>&ldquo;School of
Reform.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a wonderful impersonation.&nbsp; I have seen
nothing like it since.</p>
<p>It has always appeared to me to be a remarkable circumstance that many
actors and actresses who have been great favourites in the metropolis, have
not stood in the same light with the Liverpool audiences.&nbsp; I have
seen, occasionally, some remarkable instances of this.&nbsp; Dowton, a
great actor, never drew; James Wallack never attracted large
audiences.&nbsp; I have seen the whole Adelphi company&mdash;including
Frederick Yates, his charming wife, Paul Bedford, John Reeve, O. Smith, and
others&mdash;fail to draw; in fact at one engagement they played night
after night to almost empty benches.&nbsp; This was, I think, in
1838.&nbsp; I recollect, on one occasion, Yates seeing a band-box on the
stage, went up to it and gave it a kick, and looking significantly at the
state of the house, exclaimed, &ldquo;Get out of my sight&mdash;I hate
empty boxes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vandenhoff was always a great favourite with the Liverpool
audiences.&nbsp; There was a tremendous row once got up at the Theatre
Royal, in which he was concerned.&nbsp; About 1825, I think, Vandenhoff
went to try his fortune on the London stage, and there, if he did not
altogether fail, he did not succeed commensurate with his great
expectations; and after knocking about at several theatres, playing, I
believe, at some of the minors&mdash;the Surrey, Coburg, and Sadler&rsquo;s
Wells&mdash;he came back to Liverpool, <!-- page 243--><a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>where a Mr. Salter
had taken up the position he had vacated.&nbsp; A strong move by Mr.
Vandenhoff&rsquo;s friends was made to reinstate him on the Liverpool
Tragic Throne.&nbsp; This Mr. Salter&rsquo;s friends would not allow.&nbsp;
The consequence was that several noisy demonstrations took place on both
sides, and considerable confusion was created during the time the row was
kept up.&nbsp; To show to what length things went, I may just mention that
placards were freely exhibited in the theatre bearing the sentiments on
them of the particular side which exhibited them.&nbsp; I recollect one
caused great fun and laughter.&nbsp; It was headed &ldquo;Vandenhoff&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Salter-off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kean thought highly of Vandenhoff.&nbsp; I have seen a letter of his in
which he highly extols him, considering his style to be the purest acting
since the retirement of John Kemble.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1824, there was a great row at the Theatre Royal, which
was excited in favour of Miss Cramer, a most popular and able
vocalist.&nbsp; At that time the Music Hall in Bold-street had just been
opened, and concerts were being given under the management of Mr. Wilson,
the dancing master, whose niece by the way (Miss Bolton) was married to
John Braham, <i>il primo tenore d&rsquo;Europa</i>, as the Italians termed
him.&nbsp; Braham has often said that this Music Hall was a finer room for
sound than any that ever he was in; and at these morning concerts he
frequently sang.&nbsp; It was the <!-- page 244--><a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>custom to enlist the
aid of the vocalists, if there were any, at the Theatre Royal, to add to
the attractions of these concerts.&nbsp; The manager was always willing to
allow his singers to avail themselves of the occasion.&nbsp; However, on
Miss Cramer being offered an engagement, the manager refused to allow her
to appear.&nbsp; Miss Cramer, feeling the injustice of the case,
nevertheless sang at one of the morning concerts, and was consequently
dismissed from the Theatre Royal.&nbsp; The young lady instantly issued a
handbill stating her case, and the consequence was that the theatre was
crowded at night, and calls for &ldquo;Miss Cramer&rdquo; were
incessant.&nbsp; Mr. Banks came forward to justify himself, hoping that
both sides might be heard, but he could not obtain a hearing.&nbsp; At
length the audience grew so excited that they tore up the seats, smashed a
splendid chandelier that had only just been purchased at a cost of
&pound;500, broke all the windows in the house, and did a great deal of
damage.&nbsp; The row was continued on the night but one following, when
other damage was effected, and it was only by closing the theatre for a few
days that peace could be restored.&nbsp; Some of the rioters were
afterwards tried at Lancaster, and, I think, heavily fined.</p>
<h2><!-- page 245--><a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<p>In the year 1816, in consequence of the high price of provisions, as
mentioned in a former chapter, many persons rendered desperate by their
wants, formed themselves into gangs of robbers, and committed many daring
acts of depredation.&nbsp; Travellers were constantly stopped, ill-treated,
and robbed on the roads in the vicinity of the town; and scarcely a day
passed, without intelligence arriving of some house in the outskirts being
attacked and plundered.&nbsp; To such an extent was this carried, that
people commenced forming themselves into associations for their mutual
protection.&nbsp; In Toxteth Park, this was especially the case, as several
very serious robberies had been reported in that neighbourhood.&nbsp; It
must be remembered that at that time Toxteth Park was but thinly
populated.&nbsp; There were only a few good houses in it, occupied by <!--
page 246--><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>highly
respectable families, for the salubrious air of &ldquo;the Park,&rdquo; and
the beautiful views of the river from many parts of it, gave it attractions
to those who could live out of town.&nbsp; It was, amongst other things,
proposed, I recollect, to have as protection, large and sonorous bells put
up on the tops of the houses, so that on the least alarm of thieves, the
bells might be rung to arouse the neighbours.&nbsp; Such precautions will
be laughed at now-a-days, but something was necessary to be done at that
time, when policemen were unknown, and personal protection was by no means
much regarded.&nbsp; It was no uncommon circumstance for persons who had
occasion to go out at night, to carry a brace of pistols with them; but
whether they would have had courage to use them or not, I cannot say, but
the fact of having such things at hand were crumbs of comfort to timid
people.</p>
<p>I dare say many of my readers will remember having seen in old carriages
and gigs, a sort of round projection at the back, forming a recess from the
inside of the vehicle.&nbsp; These boxes were used for the purpose of
depositing therein a sword and pistols, so that they might be ready at hand
in case of necessity.</p>
<p>The extent to which robbery was committed in Liverpool at this period,
may be judged by the following circumstance, which many may still <!-- page
247--><a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>remember.&nbsp; On the particulars being made public people were
completely terrified at the state to which things had arrived, and several
families living in the suburbs, seriously thought of returning to reside in
the town again.</p>
<p>About the month of August, 1816, an old woman was seen prowling
constantly about the vicinity of Mr. J. A. Yates&rsquo; house, in Toxteth
Park.&nbsp; She made a great many inquiries about the members of that
gentleman&rsquo;s family, whether there were men servants in the house, and
whether a dog was kept.&nbsp; In fact, she made herself fully acquainted
with Mr. Yates&rsquo; domestic arrangements.&nbsp; This was thought nothing
of at the time, but the old crone&rsquo;s curiosity was recalled to mind
after the event took place, which I shall briefly mention.</p>
<p>On the night of Friday, 16th August, 1816, about ten o&rsquo;clock, six
men wearing masks, and armed with pistols, might have been seen approaching
Mr. Yates&rsquo; house.&nbsp; Two of them took their position outside as
sentinels to give alarm to their companions, if necessary.&nbsp; The other
four approached the back of the premises, and entered the house.&nbsp;
Passing through the scullery they went into the kitchen, where they found a
servant-maid and a footman.&nbsp; Threatening them with instant death if
they gave any alarm, one of the four remained in the kitchen to watch the
girl, while the other three compelled the footman to <!-- page 248--><a
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>show them over the
house.&nbsp; Proceeding up stairs, they encountered Mr. J. B. Yates, who
was on a visit to Mr. J. A. Yates.&nbsp; On seeing the men approach, he
inquired their business, when one of them aimed a blow at him, which,
however, fortunately missed its mark, and only inflicted a slight wound on
Mr. Yates&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp; They then ordered Mr. Yates to give up his
money, which he did, fearing further violence.&nbsp; Driving him before
them, they next entered a room, in which Mrs. J. B. Yates was
sitting.&nbsp; They compelled her also to give up her money, watch, and the
jewellery she wore.&nbsp; While this was going on, Mr. J. A. Yates arrived
from Liverpool, and was seized by the two rascals stationed outside.&nbsp;
They demanded his money, putting pistols to his head.&nbsp; Mr. Yates,
however, with a good deal of nerve, rushed past the fellows, threw his
watch away, and seized hold of the handle of the door bell, which he rung
with considerable force.&nbsp; The men, however, again seized him, and told
him his ringing would be of no use, as there were fellows inside who could
overmaster any effort of his.&nbsp; But the ringing of the door-bell had
seriously alarmed the party within, who were then robbing Mrs. Yates, as
just mentioned.&nbsp; Snatching up whatever they could, which was portable
and seemed of value, the fellows rushed down stairs, ordering the footman
to open the hall-door.&nbsp; This he did, and <!-- page 249--><a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>availed himself of
the opportunity of making his escape.&nbsp; He ran across the fields and
speedily gave an alarm, but too late to be of any service; for, when
assistance arrived, the thieves had decamped, taking with them about
&pound;14 in money, and a quantity of valuable plate and jewellery.&nbsp;
The man left in the kitchen had contrived to secure the stock of
plate.&nbsp; Four of the robbers were captured in September following, and
committed to take their trial at Lancaster, where they were found guilty
and sentenced to death.&nbsp; They were hung in October following, and it
is a rather curious circumstance that the very week these men suffered the
extreme penalty of the law for their misdeeds, a daring burglary was
committed one night at the mill near Mr. Yates&rsquo; house, when five
sacks of flour were stolen, put into a boat in waiting by the mill dam, and
successfully carried off.</p>
<p>The Waterloo Hotel was originally Mr. Gore&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; It was
afterwards occupied by Mr. Staniforth, who was in partnership with the
present Mr. Laird&rsquo;s father as ropers.&nbsp; The roperies occupied the
site of the present Arcades, and extended to Berry-street.</p>
<p>I recollect the Fall Well occupying the site of Mr. Alderman
Bennet&rsquo;s warehouse near Rose-street.&nbsp; It was covered over with
several arches; access to it was obtained down a flight of steps.&nbsp;
<!-- page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>A
tavern was afterwards built on its site, and was known for many years as
the &ldquo;Fall Well Tavern.&rdquo;&nbsp; It stood at the corner of
Rose-street at the back of the Amphitheatre.&nbsp; The Dye-House Well was
in Greetham-street.&nbsp; I believe access is still obtained to the water,
at least it was a few years ago.&nbsp; The wells on Shaw&rsquo;s brow were
all laid open when the alteration took place in that vicinity.&nbsp; One of
the wells was used at an emery mill, which was once the cone of a
pottery.&nbsp; One of the wells was found where the Library is now
erected.</p>
<h2><!-- page 251--><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<p>As a young boy and an old man I have seen my native town under two very
diverse aspects.</p>
<p>As a boy, I have seen it ranked only as a third-rate seaport.&nbsp; Its
streets tortuous and narrow, with pavements in the middle, skirted by mud
or dirt as the season happened.&nbsp; The sidewalks rough with
sharp-pointed stones, that made it misery to walk upon them.&nbsp; I have
seen houses, with little low rooms, suffice for the dwelling of the
merchant or well-to-do trader&mdash;the first being content to live in
Water-street or Old Hall-street, while the latter had no idea of leaving
his little shop, with its bay or square window, to take care of itself at
night.&nbsp; I have seen Liverpool streets with scarcely a coach or vehicle
in them, save such as trade required, and the most enlightened of its
inhabitants, at that time, could not boast of much intelligence, while
those who <!-- page 252--><a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>constituted its lower orders were plunged in the deepest vice,
ignorance, and brutality.</p>
<p>But we should not judge too harshly of those who have gone before
us.&nbsp; Of the sea-savouring greatly were the friends and acquaintances
of my youth.&nbsp; Scarcely a town by the margin of the ocean could be more
salt in its people than the men of Liverpool of the last century: so
barbarous were they in their amusements, bull-baitings and cock and
dog-fightings, and pugilistic encounters.&nbsp; What could we expect when
we opened no book to the young, and employed no means of imparting
knowledge to the old?&mdash;deriving our prosperity from two great
sources&mdash;the slave-trade and privateering.&nbsp; What could we expect
but the results we have witnessed?&nbsp; Swarming with sailor men flushed
with prize money, was it not likely that the inhabitants generally would
take a tone from what they daily beheld and quietly countenanced?&nbsp;
Have we not seen the father investing small sums in some gallant ship
fitting out for the West Indies or the Spanish Main, in the names of each
of his children, girls and boys?&nbsp; Was it not natural that they should
go down to the &ldquo;Old Dock,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Salthouse,&rdquo; or
the &ldquo;New Dock,&rdquo; and there be gratified with a sight of a ship
of which they&mdash;little as they were&mdash;were still part-owners?&nbsp;
We took them on deck and showed them where a <!-- page 253--><a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>bloody battle had
been fought&mdash;on the very deck and spot on which their little feet
pattered about.&nbsp; And did we not show them the very guns, and the
muskets, the pistols and the cutlasses, the shot-lockers and magazines, and
tell them how the lad, scrubbing a brass kettle in the caboose, had been
occupied as a powder-monkey and seen blood shed in earnest?&nbsp; And did
we not moreover tell them that if the forthcoming voyage was only
successful, and if the ships of the enemy were taken&mdash;no matter about
the streams of blood that might run through the scuppers&mdash;how their
little ventures would be raised in value many hundredfold&mdash;would not
young imaginations be excited and the greed for gain be potent in their
young hearts?&nbsp; No matter what woman might be widowed&mdash;parent made
childless, or child left without protector&mdash;if the gallant privateer
was successful that was all they were taught to look for.&nbsp; And must
not such teaching have had effect in after life?&nbsp; I have seen these
things, and know them to be true; but I have seen them, I am glad to say,
fade away, while other and better prospects have, step by step, presented
themselves to view.</p>
<p>As a man, I have seen the old narrow streets widening&mdash;the old
houses crumbling&mdash;and the salty savouring of society evaporate, and
the sea influence recede before improvement&mdash;education and
enlightenment of all sorts.&nbsp; Step by step <!-- page 254--><a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>has that sea-element
in my townsmen declined.&nbsp; The three-bottle and punch-drinking man is
the exception now, and not the rule of the table.&nbsp; The wide, open
street and the ample window is now everywhere to be found, while underneath
that street the well-constructed sewer carries off the germs of disease
that in other times rose up potently amongst us, and through that window
comes streaming the sunlight of heaven, cheering and gladdening every
heart.&nbsp; Scarcely can the man of old, who has outlived his generation,
believe in the huge edifices that now the merchant occupies, or credit his
sight, when he looks at the great shops that display their costly goods of
all descriptions, with the best of taste.&nbsp; Nor is there a less
remarkable aspect presented in the appearance of the people.&nbsp; Of old
one scarcely met a well-dressed man&mdash;now scores upon scores.&nbsp; In
bye-gone times, we scarcely beheld a carriage, lumbering and uneasy as
those things were&mdash;now we see elegant equipages of every make, shape,
and build, suitable for every style of locomotion.&nbsp; In all things have
we progressed; nor are we yet standing still.</p>
<p>We are doubling our trade.&nbsp; We are doubling our imports and
exports; we have been doubling them since 1749&mdash;about every 16
years.&nbsp; In that year the total tonnage of vessels that entered the
port of Liverpool was 28,250 tons.&nbsp; In 1764 it <!-- page 255--><a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>was 56,499 tons, in
1780 it was 112,000 tons, in 1796 it was 224,000 tons, in 1811 it was
611,190 tons, in 1827 it was 1,225,313 tons, in 1841 it was 2,425,461 tons,
in 1857 it had reached 4,645,362 tons, so that by the same rule that
doubled the tonnage of the port, between 1749 and 1764, the tonnage doubled
itself between 1841 and 1857.&nbsp; It occupied 134 years to produce an
increase equal to that which had taken place between 1841 and 1857.&nbsp;
The value of exports in the whole kingdom in 1857, amounted to
&pound;110,000,000 sterling, out of which &pound;55,000,000 passed through
Liverpool alone.&nbsp; One hundred and fifty years ago there was not a dock
in England.&nbsp; In Liverpool they now extend over five miles in
length.&nbsp; An hundred years hence?&mdash;and what then?</p>
<p>His tale being told the old man bids his readers farewell.&nbsp; He has
chronicled a few odd matters relating to his native town.&nbsp; He has
spoken of what it was, and of what it is.&nbsp; If it increase in wealth
and extent during the next century as it has done in that which is past,
our descendants may be so much in advance of us in wisdom and knowledge as
to look slightingly upon us.&nbsp; But if our sons&rsquo; sons will only
emulate our good and graceful actions, and avoid that which in us is wicked
and ignoble, they will have better reason to be proud of their ancestors
than we have of ours, or even of ourselves.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
